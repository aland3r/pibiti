2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,040
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,100
Today we will focus on learning dependency
graphs using frequencies as input.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,680
So this is a picture that I briefly
showed in the last lecture.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,310
So we are now looking at a mining
approach that is using multiple phases.

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,345
And the first phase is
learning the dependency graph.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,810
The approach that we sketch is
inspired by the heuristic miner, but

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,950
many mining techniques use
these two types of phases.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,850
Also many of the commercial mining tools,

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,600
they use algorithms that actually just
show dependency graph and nothing more.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,720
So, let's look at the problem
of learning a dependency graph.

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,060
So as a running example
I will use the C-net.

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,220
We have seen the C-net notation
in the last lecture, so

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,720
we have activities, we have dependencies
between different activities.

15
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,500
And every activity can have input and

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,990
output bindings that can be used
to model ANDs and ORs and XORs and

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,830
all kinds of routing constructs.
So, if we take this C-net model and

18
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,550
we would generate a simulation from it and
we would add some outliers.

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,430
Then this would be,
a possible log that we could get.

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,382
Note that deliberately there are two
traces in this event log a,b,e and

21
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:41,530
a,c,e which do not correspond to
valid binding sequences of the C-net.

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,770
But for all the other traces they
correspond to valid binding sequences.

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,305
So for example the trace that starts
with an e starts with an a and

24
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:53,581
ends with an e,
is one of these possible traces.

25
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,285
So, if we would take this event log and
apply the Alpha algorithm to it,

26
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:05,120
the Alpha algorithm would
have all kind of problems.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,340
And here you see the model,
that it returns.

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,060
First of all, activity d is unconnected
to all the other activities.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,245
Moreover, b and c always need to be
executed according to the model.

30
00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:22,050
Whereas if we look at the event log,

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,050
that is clearly not the case,
because we can just do a,e.

32
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,830
Which is definitely not possible
according to this model.

33
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,950
So if we are using something like
the heuristic miner or

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,360
these are types of techniques.

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,940
They will not have these problems.

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,480
One of the important ingredients is that
we take into account frequencies and

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,880
only consider the causalities
which are important.

38
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,730
So here we see a formula
that counts the number of

39
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,140
times that a was followed
by b somewhere in the log.

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,840
So we sum over all traces.

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,150
And then within a trace we see how
many times a is followed by b.

42
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,490
So if we do that, we can count
the so-called direct succession.

43
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,450
So here you see an event log.

44
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,670
And for example, if you would look at
a and c, you can see that a is followed

45
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,377
directly by c 11 times in this event log.

46
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:30,430
So it's similar to what we were
using in the Alpha algorithm.

47
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,830
But there we were just looking at
whether something was followed by

48
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,740
something else at some
position in the log.

49
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,500
But now we look at how
frequent this is happening.

50
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,540
And we are using more information now.

51
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:53,160
So, one of the ingredients for learning
the dependency graph is direct succession.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,890
How many times did one activity
follow another activity?

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,810
But we will also look at
a more sophisticated measure,

54
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,110
the so-called dependency measure,
which aims to discover causality.

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,260
If we have a model that
has concurrency in it,

56
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,300
accidentally things will
follow one another.

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,180
But we should not confuse
them with causalities.

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,320
So if you look at the formula that
you see here at the bottom, if a and

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,140
b are different.

60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,280
We count how many times
is a followed by b,

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,570
minus the number of times
that b is followed by a.

62
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,730
And we divide that by the sum
of these two numbers plus 1.

63
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,420
And in this way we always get
a number between 0 and 1.

64
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,820
If the number is close to 1,
there is a very strong causality.

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,940
If the number is negative or

66
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,090
the number is close to 0, there is
a weak causality in that direction.

67
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,020
What this formula also shows you is that
we have a special case where a equals b.

68
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,760
Because, if we apply the formula that I

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,955
just mentioned to the situation where
a equals b, it would always yield 0.

70
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,600
And that's why you have a special formula.

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,150
It simply counts how many
times is a followed by itself,

72
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,300
divided by this number plus 1.

73
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,000
And again,
we get a number between 0 and 1.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
The higher the number,

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,172
the more likely it is that there
is a dependency, a causality.

76
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:38,100
So what we see on this
slide is an example of

77
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,270
an arc in such a dependency graph,
annotated with two numbers.

78
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,020
The first number indicated in red,
45, indicates

79
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,530
how many times a was directly
followed by b somewhere in the log.

80
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,170
The other value,

81
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,450
indicated in blue, is the dependency
measure that we have just defined.

82
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,570
Right, so it's, it's computed using
the formula that we have seen earlier.

83
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:15,480
So let's take a look at these two numbers
in a set of specific situations.

84
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,000
So and in each situation we
will need to consider a threshold.

85
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,470
And both of these values, so
the value in red and the value in blue,

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,090
have to be above a certain threshold for
the arc to be included.

87
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:38,462
So we remove all arcs that do
not meet this requirement.

88
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:44,270
So, as I said, we look at a set of
patterns and see how this plays out.

89
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,160
So consider that we have a process
model where a is followed by b and

90
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,470
we see this 10 times.

91
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,230
So this picture is a bit misleading
because I am showing you a Petri net

92
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,590
to describe a set of traces.

93
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,870
So here we have 10 traces.

94
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,850
Where somewhere in the trace,
a is directly followed by b.

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,170
So, if we count the number of times that
a is followed by b, we get a number 10.

96
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,120
So, if we now apply the formula
of the dependency measure,

97
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,640
we get 10 minus 0 divided
by 10 plus 0 plus 1 is 11.

98
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,160
So the dependency measure between a and
b is 10 divided by 11.

99
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,470
If we look at the other direction, b is
never followed by a, so this number is 0.

100
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,760
And if we compute a dependency
measure between b and

101
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,030
a, so in the reverse direction.

102
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,690
We get a negative number,
namely minus 10 divided by 11.

103
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:54,040
So in this case because for
the connection between a and

104
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,930
b we meet both thresholds we say that
we want to include this causality.

105
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,200
So then we get this situation.

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,180
So the arc indicated in red is an arc that
meets the requirements of the thresholds.

107
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,130
So in this slide it shows that
we are now using a threshold of,

108
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,990
that a should be directly
followed by b at least once.

109
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,340
That is satisfied,
because we have seen it ten times, and

110
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,690
the dependency measure
should be at least half.

111
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,847
And in this case it's 0.9.

112
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,980
So this arc is definitely present.

113
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,410
Let's take a look at an XOR-split.

114
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,950
So, what we see now is 
we see much more numbers.

115
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,690
So, the traces that we look at there
are a traces, where a is followed by b.

116
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,210
And there are two traces
where a is followed by c.

117
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:51,840
And then we can apply the formula
that has been described before,

118
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,740
and these are all the numbers that we get.

119
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,750
For example, a is followed by b eight times.

120
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,732
And if we look at the dependency
measure between a and

121
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:12,887
b we take 8 minus 0 divided
by 8 plus 0 plus 1 is 9.

122
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:18,230
So we get the dependency between a and
b is 8 divided by 9.

123
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,719
So, again, we can look at what are the
connections that meet the threshold.

124
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,250
And then we find that there is indeed
a connection between a and b and

125
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,710
between a and c.

126
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,580
Just as we expected.

127
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,990
So, in the dependency graph,
we add these two red arcs and

128
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,570
the numbers are the numbers
that we have computed before.

129
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,300
And so a is followed by b, eight times,
and a is followed by c two times.

130
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,260
And the dependency measures
are indicated in blue here.

131
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,140
And they all meet the threshold.

132
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,920
The XOR-join is very similar.

133
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,250
So, what you now see is,
again, a computation.

134
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,420
We look at the traces, a traces,
where a is followed by c,

135
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,050
two traces where b is followed by c,
and these are the numbers that we get.

136
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:15,910
And again we find that there are only
two connections that meet the threshold.

137
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,680
The connection between a and c and
the connection between b and c.

138
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,870
And again we add these arcs, the red arcs,

139
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,060
because they meet the two thresholds
that have been described before.

140
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,650
Let's take a look at concurrency.

141
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,320
We take the AND-split pattern,
now we look at traces where

142
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,180
a is followed by b and c, but sometimes
c is first and sometimes b is first.

143
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,780
And assume an evenly distributed log, so

144
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,150
we see as many traces a, b,
c as we see traces a, c, b.

145
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,790
And then these
are the numbers that we get.

146
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,670
Again we can simply apply the, the,
the two formulas that we have seen before.

147
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,950
And what we see is that indeed there
is a connection between a and b.

148
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,860
There is a connection between a and c.

149
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,490
What is very important to see here
is that if we look at the log,

150
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,320
b is five times followed by c.

151
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,840
And c is five times followed by b.

152
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,090
Because they are concurrent.

153
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,150
They can happen in any order.

154
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,200
So b and c follow one another, but

155
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,720
we don't want to create
a connection between them.

156
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,430
So that's why we need
the dependency measure.

157
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,790
The dependency measure here.

158
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,480
For example, if you look at
the connection between b and

159
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,660
c, we can see that the dependency
measure is 0 divided by 11.

160
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:59,940
Because we have 5 minus 5
divided by 5 plus 5 plus 1.

161
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,700
So we just fill out the formula and
we get 0 divided by 11.

162
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,550
So we know that there is no relationship,
no dependency between b and c.

163
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,760
because it doesn't meet the threshold.

164
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,520
So in this graph it's very
important to see that there is

165
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,550
no connection between b and c.

166
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:26,050
Because these connections do
not meet the threshold b and

167
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,930
c follow one another but
they are concurrent.

168
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,812
That's why we do not want
to see this connection.

169
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:38,620
The AND-join pattern is exactly the same
as you've seen numbers very similar to

170
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,190
what we have seen before.

171
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,720
We can fill out a formula and
get the numbers that you see here.

172
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,610
Again it's crucial that you
see that there should not

173
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,100
be a connection between a and b although
they follow each other five times.

174
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,660
And that is because if
we fill out the formula for

175
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,640
the dependence measure, in this case
we get 0 rather than some high number.

176
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,050
So we we approve
the connection between a and

177
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,220
c, and b and c, but
not between a and b, or b and a.

178
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,970
And this is, again, an illustration why we
need to have this dependency measure.

179
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,480
And these are the connections that we get
in the corresponding dependency graph.

180
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,400
So far we only consider the situation
where the two activities that we

181
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,860
were comparing were different activities.

182
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,720
Now for the loop pattern, we look at
a situation where one activity

183
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
should be connected to itself because
it is involved in some kind of loop.

184
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,980
So take a look at this Petri net
where we see a self loop involving b.

185
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,350
And, if we look at the corresponding traces
it's possible corresponding traces we can

186
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,885
see ac.

187
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,050
We can see abc.

188
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,300
But we can also see abbc.

189
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,410
So, in this small event log
that we will consider.

190
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,940
We assume for
example that abbc happens three times.

191
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,150
And so one activity follows itself.

192
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:24,900
If we apply the normal formula to this,
we would get a dependency measure of 0.

193
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,260
So we would never have
a connection of b with itself.

194
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,250
But as you can see from this example,

195
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,750
sometimes this is needed if
we are involved in a loop.

196
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,010
So, let's compute the measures for
this small event log.

197
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,560
The numbers that you see here in red,

198
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,320
they are exactly computed in
the way we have seen before.

199
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,340
The values that you see here in blue.

200
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,584
They correspond to

201
00:14:56,584 --> 00:15:03,460
measures that are computed using
this special formula for loops.

202
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:11,430
So if we look at a, the dependency measure
of a with itself, it is 0 divided by 1.

203
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,060
And so, there is no connection
between a and itself.

204
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:22,160
If we look, however at b, b follows
itself three times in the event log.

205
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:31,180
And the dependency measure of b
with itself is 3 divided by 0.

206
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:39,470
And the reason is that if we apply the
formula we get 3 divided by 3 plus 1 is 4.

207
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,260
So this is how we can capture
the fact that there is a loop.

208
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:51,410
So we approve the connections including
the self loop involving b and

209
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,230
this is why we need to have this special
formula, because otherwise we would

210
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,719
lose this connection between b and
it would not be connected to the rest.

211
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:07,530
So if we apply all the formulas,
this is the dependency graph that we see.

212
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,130
And especially
the connection between b and

213
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,370
itself is important that you
understand how this was computed.

214
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,354
It meets the thresholds,
so we add the self-loop.

215
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,710
Let's take a look at the example
that we have seen before.

216
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:30,250
So, here we have the log including
two outliers and we can compute

217
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,010
how many times one activity is followed
by another, as you can see here.

218
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,314
So, the question is now
to see whether you

219
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:43,210
understand this dependency
measure given this event log.

220
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,520
What is the dependency measure for
the connection between a and b?

221
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,550
And what is the connection and

222
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,880
the value of the dependency measure of
the connection between d and itself?

223
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,680
So, take a moment to think about this.

224
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,730
This is the answer, it is showing all
the dependency measures computed for

225
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,140
all activity pairs.

226
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:11,020
And it is just computed by applying the
formula that we have described before.

227
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,080
So if we zoom in to the two activities.

228
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,470
The two dependency measures
that I've asked for.

229
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,220
The connection between a and
b and, and d and itself.

230
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,860
Then we can simply look
up the values in how many

231
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,090
times one activity was
followed by the other.

232
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,900
And we can apply the formula.

233
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,990
And we get this value.

234
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,370
If we look at how many times d was
followed by itself, we can look that up.

235
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,080
And we apply the second formula.

236
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,910
And then we get the number
that you can see here.

237
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,689
So this shows how you can
compute the dependency measures.

238
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,740
So, we have these thresholds.

239
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,670
There is a threshold for the number
of times that an activity should be

240
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,690
followed by another activity and
the strength of the dependency.

241
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,300
If both meet the thresholds,
arcs are included.

242
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,370
So, if we use the thresholds where
we set the threshold rather low,

243
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,630
then all of the connections that you
see here in the graph will be included.

244
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,180
If we increase the threshold a bit so
we have more stricter requirements

245
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,080
with respect to the dependency measure
and the frequency.

246
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,000
Then we can see that two
arcs are disappearing.

247
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,110
So compared to the previous slide,
we, for

248
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:44,570
example, now see that the self
loop involving d has disappeared.

249
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,560
And there is no longer a connection
between the first activity and

250
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,280
the last activity.

251
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,780
And so by playing with these thresholds
we can make the dependency graph simpler.

252
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,640
So what is the algorithm?

253
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,020
So first we set thresholds then
we count direct successions.

254
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,530
Then we compute the dependency measures
using the two formulas discussed and

255
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,730
then we draw the dependency
graph including only the arcs

256
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,860
that meet both thresholds and
then we get the dependency graph.

257
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,440
Please practice this yourself on small
example logs to see whether you

258
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,800
really understand how it works.

259
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,300
As I mentioned before many
algorithms use something very

260
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,120
similar to dependency graphs.

261
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,500
If you look at Disco,
you can think of the models that you see

262
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,107
as dependency graphs rather
than something more explicit,

263
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:48,900
having more explicit semantics like
a Petri net or a BPMN model.

264
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,710
So if you look at Disco,
you can play with the threshold.

265
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,620
So if you set the threshold very low,
as indicated high here,

266
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,113
you will see that all
the arcs are included.

267
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:06,930
If you then move the slider down you

268
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,410
will see that more and more connections
do not meet the thresholds and disappear.

269
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,360
So the model gets simpler and simpler.

270
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,640
So this is using exactly the same type
of ideas, although the underlying

271
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,639
algorithms are different than the things
that we have seen in this lecture.

272
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,050
So the next step that we will
look at in the next lecture

273
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,780
is once we have this dependency graph,
how can we

274
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,580
compute the split and
join behavior of all of these nodes.

275
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,634
So we aim at creating so called C-nets.

276
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,990
If you want to read more
about this in chapter six you

277
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,320
can read everything about
learning these dependency graphs.

278
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,557
Thank you for watching,
and hope to see you soon.
