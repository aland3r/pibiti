2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,730
Glad to see you again.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,380
In the previous lecture, we introduced
the topic of conformance checking.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,830
There are many situations where we
would like to compare modeled and

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,710
observed behavior.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,750
Today we will discuss a particular
technique to check conformance.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,740
This technique is called causal
footprints, and the idea is based on one

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,050
of the ingredients of the alpha algorithm
that we saw in an earlier lecture.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,900
When we introduce the alpha algorithm,
we used matrices like this.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,410
This is called the footprint
of a particular log.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,550
We are using notions such as causality,
parallel, and choice.

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,260
And they are based on the direct
succession relationship.

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,460
For example, if you take a look at
this particular causal footprint,

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,760
you will see that this arrow is
indicating that a is followed by b,

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,310
at least once in the log, but it is
never the case that b is followed by a.

16
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,270
This parallel symbol is indicating
that b is sometimes followed by c,

17
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,960
and c is sometimes followed by b.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,850
So they happen in both directions.

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,100
Then there is this symbol, which is the
choice symbol, which is indicating that b

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,630
is never followed by e and
e is never followed by b.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,290
So these are the ingredients
of creating a footprint and

22
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,280
it is very important to realize that we
can create a footprint-based on a log.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,880
But that we can also create
a footprint placed on a model,

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,550
because a model can generate traces.

25
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,520
And also by statical analysis
of these types of models,

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,760
we can already derive this
matrix with all the causalities.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,600
In this case, there's a process model
discovered by the alpha algorithm.

28
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,130
Both have the same causal footprint,
and so there are no differences.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,210
What we are going to do
next is we are going to look at

30
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,540
the more complicated log, and we are going
to consider four different process models.

31
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,990
Some match well with original log.

32
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,070
Others do not.

33
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,970
And we will use the footprints
to analyze these differences.

34
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,240
Let's take a look at the full log and
the causal footprint related to it.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,060
It's shown here.

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,040
If we apply the alpha algorithm we get
the model that is shown here on the right.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,810
And in this model when we analyze it, the set of
traces we find exactly the same footprint.

38
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,280
So the footprint of log and
model coincide.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,860
In this case we say that the
footprint-based conformance equals to 1.

40
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,815
This means that there is a perfect match.

41
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:13,490
If the footprint-based conformance
metric has a very low value,

42
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,930
it means that there is not a good
match between log and model.

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,570
This is computed as the fraction of cells
in the footprint matrix where log and

44
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,690
model agree upon.

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,610
So let's now take a look
at the second model,

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,590
which is not a perfect match
with the original event log.

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,120
For example if you look
here at the cell of a and

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,450
d, you can see that a is
never followed by d.

49
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,280
This followed by b and

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,320
c, but never followed by d,
which was the case in the original log.

51
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,210
So, we can create such a causal
footprint based on this model.

52
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:06,880
And then we can compare the footprint of
model two with the original event log.

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,405
And we can put these two matrices on top
of each other and look at the differences.

54
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,720
For example, we see that indeed in the log

55
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,740
a is sometimes followed by d,
but never the other way around.

56
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,670
And in the model, model N2, a and
d never follow one another.

57
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,300
So we see a difference there.

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,740
We can also take a look at b and
d and we see that, in the event log,

59
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,850
they are considered to be concurrent
because they happen in any order.

60
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,130
But if we look at the model N2,
we see that b is followed by d,

61
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,520
but d is never followed by b.

62
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,170
And in such a way we can analyze

63
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,720
all the differences between
the original log and model N2.

64
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,600
Here the differences are highlighted.

65
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,150
And we can count them and
we can diagnose them.

66
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,520
So here in the matrix we
just see the differences.

67
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,310
So for example we can see
that if we look at b and

68
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,040
d, in the log it was parallel,
in the model it was sequential.

69
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,230
And we can count these differences.

70
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,390
So there are 64 cells.

71
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,520
And in 12 of these cells,
there is disagreement.

72
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,390
So it's 1 minus 12 divided by 64 is
a footprint-based conformance of 0.8125.

73
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,350
So, this way we can quantify
differences between log and model.

74
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,970
We can also provide
diagnostics as is shown here.

75
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,450
The elements of the footprint matrix,
where model and

76
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,880
log disagree,
you can visualize them in the model.

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,880
For example,
the visualization here is showing that in

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,920
the original log a could be followed by d,
but this is no longer possible.

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,710
So, we can diagnose differences,
we can also quantify them.

80
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,790
Let's now take a look at a question.

81
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,430
So, now we are taking another model and

82
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,590
the two models that we
have considered before.

83
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:27,780
And I would like to ask you to estimate
the footprint-based conformance

84
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,260
based on the original event log and
the model that is shown here.

85
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,320
So how can we compute this?

86
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,900
We take the original footprint
matrix of the event log.

87
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,560
We take the model, and
then we see where the footprint matrix of

88
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,390
the model disagrees with
the footprint of the original log.

89
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,990
And these are highlighted here.

90
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,010
So what we can see is that in
the model many activities are missing.

91
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,710
These missing activities in the model
will never follow one another or

92
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,250
any of the other activities.

93
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,830
Whereas in the original
event log they did.

94
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,140
Again we can count the differences.

95
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,230
In this case there are 16 cells where

96
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,440
there is disagreement between log and
model.

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,915
And that leads to a footprint-based
conformance of 0.75.

98
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,100
Let's take a look at another model.

99
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,310
This is the flower model,
which allows for lots of behavior.

100
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,970
And again, try to estimate what you think

101
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,510
is the footprint-based conformance between
the original log and this flower model.

102
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,910
To answer this question,
we do the same as what we did before.

103
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,440
We take the original footprint and

104
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,200
compare it with the footprint
of the process model.

105
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,890
This process model allows for

106
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,780
much more behavior than what
we have seen in the log.

107
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,430
So if we visualize the differences, you
can see that in total there are 45 cells

108
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:14,398
different, and that leads to
a very low conformance of 0.29.

109
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:21,410
And so this has a worse conformance than
the three models that we have seen before.

110
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,664
Because of the massive amount of
additional behavior allowed by

111
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,009
this flower model.

112
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,320
Causal footprints
are incredibly flexible.

113
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,610
In the sense that you can compare logs to
logs, you can compare models to models,

114
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,230
and you can compare models to event logs.

115
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,040
And so
we can make many different comparisons.

116
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,350
It also implicitly captures fitness,
precision, and

117
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,310
generalization, but
in a rather indirect way.

118
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,250
The approach also has many limitations.

119
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,310
So, for example, we do not look at
the frequencies of traces in the log.

120
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,570
Behavior is only considered indirectly.

121
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,660
We only consider directly
follows relations when

122
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,890
building the footprint metrics.

123
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,050
So, you can have two different processes
that have exactly the same footprint,

124
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,040
although their behavior are different,

125
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,300
as long as they have the same
directly follows relationship.

126
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,280
In one go, we address issues like fitness,
precision, and generalization.

127
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,840
But often you want to
have separate metrics for

128
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,800
these different conformance dimensions.

129
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,780
This is why,
in the next two lectures we will look

130
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,580
at additional conformance
checking techniques.

131
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,657
In the next lecture we will look
at so-called token-based replay.

132
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,320
If you would like to read
more on conformance checking,

133
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,575
you can take a look at Chapter 7.

134
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,260
Thank you for watching this lecture.

135
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,945
See you next time.
