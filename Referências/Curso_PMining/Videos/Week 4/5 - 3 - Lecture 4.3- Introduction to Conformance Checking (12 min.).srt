2
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:09,280
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,940
Thus far,
our main focus was on process discovery.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,150
In this lecture today, we will introduce
another very important process mining

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,389
task, namely conformance checking.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,692
This is a diagram that we have
seen several times before, and

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,689
it is now highlighting where
conformance checking fits in.

8
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,709
So we no longer want to discover
a process model, but we would like

9
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:38,165
to compare a process
model with the corresponding event log.

10
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,234
When doing conformance checking,

11
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:46,812
we need to take into consideration
the four dimensions that

12
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:51,550
we've also discussed when we were
looking at process discovery techniques.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,900
However in many of the conformance
checking techniques, replay fitness,

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,270
the ability to replay the event log

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,790
on the model is the thing
which is most important.

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,500
And also, many of the techniques that we

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,640
will discuss in this lecture
will focus on that dimension.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,910
But it doesn't mean that the other
dimensions are not important.

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,320
When we look at replay fitness,
we have already seen the principle before.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,610
So the basic idea is that we would
like to replay traces that we

21
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,840
have seen in the log on top of a model.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,950
So we have executed a and c and now
the event log says that we should do e.

23
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,440
But if you look at the model and

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,050
you look at the state that we are in,
e is not yet enabled.

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,620
So we need to force the process forward,

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,500
although we see that something
does not fit completely.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,690
And we go towards the end.

28
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,879
But while doing that, we are counting
how many problems we see, and

29
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,623
we are also recording the types
of problems that we have seen.

30
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,976
So this is what we are trying to
do if we are checking for fitness.

31
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:17,730
If we do this we are comparing observed
behavior with modeled behavior.

32
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,280
So, the kind of diagnostics that
we can show are diagnostics at

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,460
the level of an event log.

34
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:30,130
For example, these are the traces
that do not fit well into the model.

35
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,520
We can also provide
diagnostics at the model level,

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,829
showing the parts of the model
where reality often deviates.

37
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,820
Or we can look at global metrics.

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,630
For example,
we will often look at a fitness metric,

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,320
having a value between zero and one,

40
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,080
where zero means that fitness is very
poor and a fitness of one means that

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
everything that was seen in the log was
indeed possible according to the model.

42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,030
So what are use cases for
conformance checking?

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,630
The first use case is related
to auditing and compliance.

44
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,790
Things at the level of business processes.

45
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,640
We would like to understand,
do people deviate?

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
Why do they deviate?

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,080
Are the things that are reported,
reported correctly?

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,520
Another use case is that we want
to use conformance checking to

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,230
evaluate the quality of process
discovery algorithms and their results.

50
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,900
Last but not least, often we also want to

51
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,440
check conformance to some specification
based on the actual behavior.

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,610
For example, if we have a piece
of software and that software has

53
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,540
a specification describing how it should
work, we can compare it with a real

54
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,360
event log and see where the software
is deviating from the specification.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,260
Also if we provide services,
we can also check

56
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,330
whether the description of the service
is consistent with the actual behavior.

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,040
So there are many different use cases.

58
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,130
For all of these cases we
need to have a model that we

59
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,970
are checking the event logs to.

60
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,030
And these models, in our case it will
typically be a Petri net.

61
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,350
But it can also be any set of rule or

62
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,230
any set of model that captures
some kind of behavior.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,730
If we look at auditing,
the basic idea is to

64
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,900
check whether what was reported
was reported correctly.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,190
And this is done to check whether
business processes are executed within

66
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,080
the boundaries set by managers,
governments, and other stakeholders.

67
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,210
And these boundaries are expressed
in terms of a process model or

68
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,750
a set of rules.

69
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,271
And one can think of rules
as small process models.

70
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:03,789
In the last couple of years there has
been lots of emphasis on compliance and

71
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,700
auditing related issues.

72
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,400
Many of you know the term Sarbanes-Oxley.

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,690
And that is referring legislation
that has been created

74
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,930
to ensure that organizations are doing
what they say they are doing.

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,840
A completely different use
case is the evaluation of

76
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,110
process discovery algorithms.

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,160
Suppose that I have four algorithms.

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,530
I use these algorithms.

79
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,080
I get four process models.

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,000
And then I would like to know which is
the best process discovery technique.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,820
And we can compare them using conformance
checking, typically looking at the four

82
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,560
dimensions fitness, simplicity,
generalization and precision.

83
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,180
This is not an easy task.

84
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,050
If we try to compare the results of
different process discovery algorithms.

85
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,210
Or when a process discovery
algorithm has a lot of parameters.

86
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,380
We can also create many discovered models.

87
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,230
What are the best models
that we can look at?

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,720
In this diagram every red dot corresponds
to a discovered process model.

89
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,660
And the two dimensions indicate how
well the fitness of that model is and

90
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,770
how well the precision of that model is.

91
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,230
Then the question is,
what are good models to consider?

92
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,920
That is not the single best model,
because what you can clearly see in

93
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,319
this diagram is that there is apparently
a tradeoff between precision and fitness.

94
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,080
So if we pick a model on
the so-called Pareto front,

95
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,800
then we are looking at a model for

96
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,130
which there are no other models
that are better in all dimensions.

97
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:58,640
So, the model highlighted
here is Pareto optimal.

98
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,840
And, because this model exists,
the models indicated in grey

99
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,510
cannot be Pareto optimal if we
just look at these two dimensions.

100
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,640
We can take a look at another
model on the Pareto front and

101
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,400
again you can see that a couple
of models are discarded.

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,860
Because they are dominated by the models,
the models on the Pareto front.

103
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,770
You can do that for all the models on the
Pareto front and then we get red dots.

104
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,300
And if we are just interested
in these two dimensions,

105
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,040
these are all the models that we should
inspect because they are interesting.

106
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,670
The other models are not
interesting because there is

107
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,720
always a model that is better, or
at least as good in all the dimensions.

108
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,850
So far, we considered two dimensions,
fitness and precision, and

109
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:57,515
in this diagram you can see that model 5
is being dominated by model two because

110
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:01,630
model 2 is better in terms of fitness and
is better in terms of precision.

111
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,630
However, if we include a third dimension,

112
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,025
it may be that model 5
is on the Pareto front.

113
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:17,230
So if we, for example, plots fitness
against simplicity, one can see that

114
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,410
if you look at model 5 it is no
longer dominated by model 2 or

115
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,470
any of the other models.

116
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,700
So there is no model that at the same
time has a better fitness, precision and

117
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,410
simplicity, than model 5.

118
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,600
So it's not dominated.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,960
So it is on the Pareto front.

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,620
And so we are interested in the models
that are on the Pareto front.

121
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,390
And compare and discover models is not
very easy, because one model can be better

122
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:53,110
in terms of fitness but worse in terms
of simplicity or the other way around.

123
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,180
So there is no such
thing as the best model.

124
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,970
And that is very

125
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,210
important to understand when you're
looking at process discovery.

126
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,520
Let's get back to
compliance-related questions.

127
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,910
So, we are comparing an event
log with the process model.

128
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,760
If there are deviations,
an obvious question to ask is,

129
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,270
is the model wrong or is the log wrong?

130
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,270
And both can be the case.

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,940
So deviations may be
considered to be good or bad.

132
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,870
In this context,
we often talk about breaking the glass.

133
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,530
In many processes, people deliberately
deviate from the process and

134
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,240
in that way do something good.

135
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,680
Ans so for example,
in hospitals doctors will deviate and

136
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,920
by these deviations they are
saving the lives of patients.

137
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,580
We can also look for positive deviants.

138
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,440
Things that deviate but
in a positive manner.

139
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,030
And so deviations are not always negative.

140
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,990
And it is not always the case that
the process model is right and

141
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,010
the event log is wrong.

142
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,930
So far we have been discussing
conformance checking mostly offline.

143
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,220
But, of course,
you can also that at the runtime.

144
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,058
Online conformance checking means that
the moment that the deviation occurs,

145
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,769
you immediately generate an alert.

146
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:31,804
In the next couple of lectures we
will focus on conformance checking

147
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:35,670
techniques and thereby we often
focus just on control flow.

148
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,080
We also typically do not look
at the simplicity of the model.

149
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,540
We can of course do conformance
checking for models with data or time.

150
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,820
For example, the model specifies that
a case should be handled within 30 days.

151
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,500
But the first type of techniques
that we will look at do not do that.

152
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,573
In the next lectures we will look at three
types of approaches, causal footprints,

153
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:08,370
token-based replay and
alignment-based conformance checking.

154
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,700
And in the next lecture,
we will start with causal footprints.

155
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,050
If you would like to read more
about conformance checking,

156
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,210
Chapter 7 is devoted to it.

157
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,544
Thank you for watching,
and hope to see you soon.
