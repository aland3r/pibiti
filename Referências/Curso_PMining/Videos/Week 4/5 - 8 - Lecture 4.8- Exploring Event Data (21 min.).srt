2
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:08,460
Glad to see you again.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,190
Process models are very important for
understanding and improving processes.

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,110
However sometimes it is
better to first explore the event data.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,090
Today we will show that dotted charts can
provide valuable insights in the early

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,220
stages of a process mining project.

7
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:33,200
Lion's share of attention so far has gone
to the output side, creating models.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,530
Today we will look at the input side.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,250
We will look at event logs, and

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,500
we will see that there are different
ways of exploring them.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,410
And in particular, we will look at the
dotted chart to create a helicopter view

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,810
of the event data that we
are trying to analyze.

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,620
This is the simplistic view of event
data that we have used so far.

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,560
So one can think of it as a table where
every row corresponds to an event.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,890
Each event should have a case ID,
an activity name and a time stamp.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,130
And sometimes we have resource
information for other data.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,720
However the real picture
is a bit more involved.

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,350
To illustrate this we are using this so
called object model

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,780
which is relating process models to
event data and is showing the structure

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,140
of events and their relations
to activities and processes.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,320
So let's first take a look at
the part that we know very well.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,210
So if we look at an event, an event
always belongs to a case, precisely one.

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,680
A case can be composed of more events,
and a case belongs to a process.

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,190
And a process may of course
have multiple cases.

25
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,530
If we look at an event,
events have attributes.

26
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,480
They refer to an activity, but we also
have other attributes like timestamps,

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,772
resources, costs,
transactional information, etcetera.

28
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:09,820
So timestamps are very important for
the ordering of events, and for

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,250
doing performance analysis.

30
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,630
Resources refer to people, organizations,

31
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,160
machines, that are needed to
execute a particular activity.

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,603
They are also very important for
analysis so

33
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:29,780
you should try to exploit this
in whatever way possible.

34
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,370
So far we didn't give a lot of attention
to transactional information but

35
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,950
many event logs contain
information referring to

36
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,210
the start time of an activity,
the end time of an activity.

37
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,550
Whether it was suspended,
resumed, etcetera.

38
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,630
So, let us focus on this
transactional information.

39
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,170
We assume that there is a particular
transactional model that

40
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,850
activities follow.

41
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,620
And here you see the most detailed
transactional model that is being

42
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,560
considered in the context
of process mining.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:17,630
So we see many different activities
relating to when things have started,

44
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,600
when things have completed, whether things
have been aborted, etcetera, etcetera.

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,856
So the simplest scenario is where we
just have one event per activity,

46
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:31,290
this is so called completion event.

47
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,640
And, if we, we look at many logs,
they don't really have

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,910
this transactional information and we
interpret it as being a complete action.

49
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,100
There are also cases when we have
a start event and a complete event.

50
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,010
This is very important if we would like
to measure the duration of an activity.

51
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,810
So one activity has two events,
a start event and a complete event.

52
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,350
But much more involved
scenarios are possible, and

53
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,180
here you can see some examples.

54
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,220
So it may be that an activity was started,
but

55
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,120
then was suspended for some time,
then resumed, possibly also aborted.

56
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,730
So, what we see here
are so-called activity instances.

57
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,980
And we can think of them as paths
through the life cycle model that is

58
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,390
shown at the bottom of this slide.

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,850
There can be multiple instances of
the same activity within the same case.

60
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,910
For example, if we would have a loop,

61
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,900
then this would be a typical
pattern that we could see.

62
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,770
We see for activity a, a start and
a complete, then another start and

63
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,030
a complete, etcetera.

64
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,270
But there may also be situations
where it is less clear.

65
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,020
So here we see, an activity,

66
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,870
a, that has two instances because we see
two starts and we see two completes.

67
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,390
But we can assume that this
is what has happened or

68
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,150
we can assume that this
is what has happened.

69
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,980
So it's unclear which start
corresponds to which complete.

70
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,950
So we have these two possibilities.

71
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,210
So how to resolve this possible confusion?

72
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,340
Well one way is that events,
when they are being recorded,

73
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,810
they already have explicit references
to so called activity instances.

74
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,040
So that we know which start,
corresponds to which complete.

75
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,140
It's also possible that we
don't have this information.

76
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,540
And then, when we are replaying the log,
we can simply create it or compute it.

77
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,960
Note that this is just one of several
possible confusions that may arise.

78
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,970
For example,
it may also be that we have two starts and

79
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,470
just one complete, and so
one complete is missing.

80
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,350
How do we create these activity instances?

81
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,979
One can use all kinds of heuristics
to resolve these types of issues.

82
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,060
So let's assume that we have
these activity instances.

83
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,740
If we have these activity instances, there
is a clear relationship between an event

84
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,520
and an activity instance, and activity
instance corresponds to an activity.

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,150
So events are related to
activities in this way.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,670
So this is often the key part
of control flow discovery,

87
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,870
that we can relate events to
activities in a process model.

88
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,450
So far we looked at attributes
at the event level.

89
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,900
But as shown on this slide it may also
be the case that the case as a whole,

90
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,220
has attributes.

91
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,370
For example, the type of a customer,
the birth date of a patient,

92
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,010
the flow time of a case.

93
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,850
These are not properties
of an individual event but

94
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,030
of the case as a whole, and
we can exploit them using process mining.

95
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,640
Note that sometimes we will need to

96
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,250
compute these attributes of cases or
events.

97
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,640
So for example, the flow time of
a case can be computed based on

98
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,790
the first event of a case and
the last event of a case.

99
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,490
In general, there may be many attributes
that we would like to compute.

100
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:27,120
These are called derived attributes,
and they may use information not only

101
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,730
of the given case that we are analyzing,
but of the whole context of that case.

102
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,440
So for example, when an event was being
executed, how busy was it in the process?

103
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,760
How many resources were available?

104
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,190
How many cases were pending?

105
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,840
We can look at the workload
of individual resources and

106
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,570
add that as an attribute of the event so
that we can use this at a later stage.

107
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,485
So it's very important to relate
context information to events and

108
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:02,650
cases if you would like to do
a more refined type of analysis.

109
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,410
This picture illustrates
why this is crucial.

110
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,420
For example, if we are interested in
understanding why there are delays in

111
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:19,010
a process and we would look at one case,
for example one customer in isolation,

112
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,630
we would not be able to see and
understand the whole picture.

113
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,860
So we need to related individual events
and cases to the overall context.

114
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,850
Okay, let us now take
a look at a dotted chart.

115
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,110
This is a technique to explore event
data before we start building model.

116
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,180
And it often reveals very intriguing and
interesting information.

117
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,830
So what is the basic
idea of a dotted chart?

118
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,470
We already briefly have seen examples
before, so it is an helicopter view,

119
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,890
showing all the events.

120
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,980
Every dot corresponds to an event and
we have two axes.

121
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:06,820
On the x-axis we plot time, on the
y-axis we can plot properties of events.

122
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,240
For example, the case they belong to,

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,590
the resource that was executing the event,
or the task that was being executed.

124
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,360
We can also color these dots.

125
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,329
It can, for example, be based on the the
person that was executing that event.

126
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,570
It's best to show this using examples,
and in ProM,

127
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,960
there are two plugins
that create dotted chart.

128
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,270
It's a dotted chart plugin,
and it's a so-called viewer.

129
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,440
It's the XDotted chart.

130
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,540
But the concepts that they
use are very similar.

131
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,790
However, sometimes you need to
use one rather than the other.

132
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,190
For example, if you're running
into performance problems.

133
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,790
In the remainder of this lecture
I will focus on the dotted chart.

134
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,150
But in the XDotted chart you will
see very similar functionality.

135
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,220
To illustrate a dotted chart,
let us take a look at an event log.

136
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,840
What it represents is not that important,
but

137
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,730
we have 500 cases and
more than 7500 events.

138
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,920
How can we explore them
using the dotted chart?

139
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,002
Well, to get an understanding
of the process behind,

140
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:24,430
the dotted charts that we will
see in the remainder, here you

141
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,440
see a process model that was automatically
discovered using the inductive miner.

142
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,450
So if the process starts
with one activity,

143
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,790
then there are three activities
that are concurrent.

144
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,120
But they are all optional.

145
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,430
They can all be bypassed.

146
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,530
Then there is a sequence of activities and
there is a loop.

147
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,410
Sometimes things need to be repeated.

148
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,180
And at the end there is a decision,
accept or reject.

149
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,610
This is a model created
by the inductive miner.

150
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,220
It's a process tree.

151
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,700
We can also visualize it as a BPMN model.

152
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,640
Or we can visualize it as a Petri net.

153
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,010
But the goal of this lecture is
not to look at the process models.

154
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,780
I only show you these models so

155
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,210
that you have an understanding of
the data that we are trying to explore.

156
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,880
Typically you do it in
the other way around.

157
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,140
So here is a dotted chart of
the data set that I just described.

158
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,880
So what we are plotting here,
on the one axis we have the time,

159
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,790
in this case the actual time.

160
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,470
On the other axis, on the y-axis,
every line corresponds to a case.

161
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,980
And the color of the dot is
the activity that is being executed.

162
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,500
So if we now zoom in into one line
we are looking at one case, and

163
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,520
for this one case we can see
a sequence of event that have happened.

164
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,100
And the color is indicating which event it
was, which activity it was that occurred.

165
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,030
We can also take another view.

166
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,330
Now, we again use absolute time
of the x-axis, but on the y-axis,

167
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,620
we are plotting the activities that we
could earlier see in the process model.

168
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,260
So, we can see at what points in time
particular activities were being executed.

169
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
And you can see that there
are certain patterns emerging here.

170
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,920
So, we have activities versus actual time,
the color of the dot is the activity.

171
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,860
This is exactly the same diagram but

172
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,030
it is illustrating that we can
change the coloring of the dot.

173
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,520
Now the coloring of the dot refers to the
resource that is executing a particular

174
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,810
activity and you can see a clear
correlation between certain colors and

175
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,910
certain rows,
indicating that particular types of

176
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,060
resources execute particular
sets of activities.

177
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,750
This is the same plot but
now on the y-axis we plot the resources.

178
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,930
The color of the dot is the activity.

179
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,800
So this picture can be seen as
orthogonal to the previous one.

180
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,800
And now we can see at what points in
time our particular resource is busy.

181
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,450
We can change the color of the dots.

182
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,540
So what you see here is that we started
with the coloring based on activities and

183
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:27,450
now the coloring is based on the resources
executing all the different events.

184
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,160
So far we looked at absolute time.

185
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,380
Here you see a picture where we
are using relative time on the x-axis.

186
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,740
So all the cases start at time 0.

187
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,790
And they all start with the same activity,

188
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,970
as is clearly visible
here by the red line.

189
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:49,300
But you can also see that certain
cases take a very short time.

190
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,670
The one at the top, versus other
cases take a much longer time.

191
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,500
These are the ones that you
can find at the bottom.

192
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,666
So this gives often an insight
in the duration of the cases.

193
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:07,050
We can also plot this in a different way.

194
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,350
For example, looking at the activities
that are being executed.

195
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,540
So again, it's the same idea.

196
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:22,730
But now, rather than cases on
the y-axis, we plot activities.

197
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,560
Again, time is relative,
everything starts at time zero.

198
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,100
This is logical time, so now we do not
care about the actual time differences,

199
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,470
but we look at what is the first event
in a case, what is the second event in

200
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,090
the case, what is the third event in
the case, and plot them in this way.

201
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,590
So, again,
on the y-axis we have cases, but

202
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,930
on the x-axis we have the logical time.

203
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,530
And again,
we can choose the coloring of the dot.

204
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,100
I've showed you

205
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,058
now many dotted charts, so what can we
actually see if we look at this data set?

206
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:04,420
If you, look at

207
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,680
what you can observe,
is that it is not a straight line.

208
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,100
It's not a straight diagonal line.

209
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,560
So the speed at which cases
is arriving is varying,

210
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,580
as is clearly indicated
here by the yellow line.

211
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,240
We also see these strange gaps.

212
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,910
The first one may not be that clear but
the second and third gap are very obvious.

213
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,840
So let's try to analyze
these in a bit more detail.

214
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,060
So if you look at the first gap and
we zoom in, which you can do with a dotted

215
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:45,240
chart then what we see is that
there is a period where various

216
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,390
activities are still being executed,
but no decisions are being made.

217
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,730
There's a two month period
without any decisions.

218
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,950
This is creating that cases
take longer as you can see in

219
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,480
the previous slide.

220
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,570
We can zoom into this problem in more
detail by looking at the resources.

221
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,320
And what this diagram shows
is that the resource taking

222
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,820
the decisions was inactive for
this period of two months.

223
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,830
Let us now take a look at the second gap.

224
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,910
Is it the same or
does it have a different reason?

225
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,470
If we take a look at the second gap
then we see that there is a period,

226
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,050
six weeks,
where there is no activity at all.

227
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,070
And at the end of the period we
suddenly see a burst of red dots and

228
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,250
these correspond to the first
activity executed in this process.

229
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,660
So apparently nothing could happen for
awhile.

230
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,530
No new cases were accepted.

231
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,770
And then suddenly many
new cases were created.

232
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,020
So let's try to understand it.

233
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,480
What we see here is that
the first resource and

234
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,110
the fifth resource are the only resources,
executed this initial activity.

235
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,320
And they were absent for a particular
period thereby also causing that

236
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,080
other people in the process could also not
work because no new cases were accepted.

237
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,080
If we look at the third gap,

238
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,500
we can see very similar problems
compared to the first one.

239
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,660
So, still, new cases are arriving but
no decisions are made for

240
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,140
an extended, period.

241
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,750
Let us take a look at another event
log taken from a Dutch housing agency.

242
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,740
So we use the following
settings to plot the chart.

243
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,280
So again we have actual time and

244
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,780
we are looking at every
row corresponds to a case.

245
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,220
And the color of the dot is based
on the activity that is being executed.

246
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,660
So, take a look at this dotted
chart of a real housing agency

247
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,520
and try to see what kind of
strange patterns you see.

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,150
Well the first thing that you can note
is that the arrival rate is increasing.

249
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,540
Because the line is curved
it means that more and

250
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,960
more cases at a higher speed
are arriving into this process.

251
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,380
Second you can see that there
are these vertical lines.

252
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,690
If you look carefully you can see
that things are being batched.

253
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,830
So for many cases the same activity is

254
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,020
happening within a very
small period of time.

255
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,690
We can zoom into the latter issue.

256
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,300
So you can
clearly see these patterns.

257
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,710
So, for example,
if we take a look at the top pattern,

258
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,940
then there was this short period of just

259
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,240
a few days where these activities
were being executed for these cases.

260
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,940
And in many of these cases
had been waiting for

261
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,750
a long time for
these activities to happen.

262
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,250
So, these activities correspond
to billing and archiving.

263
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,630
So, apparently here, a resource was not
available for a longer period of time.

264
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,910
And then in a very short period of time,

265
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,560
did all the work that had
been accumulating over weeks.

266
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,760
So in this lecture, we focused on
the input side of process mining.

267
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,830
We've seen that a dotted chart can
provide many interesting insights

268
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,670
that we need to look at before
we start creating models.

269
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,840
What we could also see is
that in event data there is

270
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,490
much more information than just
information about activities.

271
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,920
We have timing information.

272
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,339
We have information about resources,
and we should try to explore these.

273
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,710
So this is what will happen in
the next couple of lectures.

274
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,210
You can take a look at these two chapters
to read more about dotted charts and

275
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,120
analysis of processes using these
other perspectives like resources,

276
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,410
time and data.

277
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,510
Thank you for watching this lecture.

278
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,554
See you next time.
