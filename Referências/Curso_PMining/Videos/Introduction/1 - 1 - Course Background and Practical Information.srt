2
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:12,070
Welcome to this course, process mining,
data science in action.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,980
The goal of this short movie is to provide
you with some background information on

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,480
the instructors, the organizations,
organizing this course, and

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,965
some practical information.

6
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:28,815
TU/e is the university
organizing this MOOC.

7
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:33,640
TU/e is one of the leading technical
universities in Europe and

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,510
it has a rich history in engineering.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,910
For example, in computer science Dyskra a
famous touring award winner, worked here.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,720
He was, for example, the person that
invented the shortest path algorithm.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,890
But there are not only
scientists in this region.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,670
In the broader Eindhoven region,
which is called Brainport,

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,860
there are many high tech companies
like Phillips, ASML and many others.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,010
So it's a vibrant region with many
organizations producing and using data.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,230
That is the reason why this university
started the Data Science Center in 2013.

16
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:21,500
The Data Science Center
is a virtual organization

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,420
consisting of 25 research groups
covering all aspect of data science.

18
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,380
So in the yellow box you see
the disciplines that are involved

19
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,169
to produce data and
to handle large volumes of events.

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,829
In the red box you see all
kinds of disciplines related to

21
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,799
analysing event data.

22
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,660
And of course, process mining,

23
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,390
the topic of this course,
is a very important ingredient in this.

24
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,360
In the green box, you can see
the context part of data signs.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,860
So in the end, we would like data
signs to be used in practice.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,790
So we need to think about ethical
aspects and the business value of data.

27
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,150
Let's tell a bit about myself.

28
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,760
So my name is Will van der Aalst.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,040
You can see here a picture of my favorite
hobby, walking and climbing in the Alps.

30
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm 48 years old.

31
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,500
I, I'm married.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,630
I have four children.

33
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,030
And if I'm not walking
in the mountains and

34
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,050
spending time with my family,
I'm having these roles.

35
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,930
So, I'm a professor at
the Technical University of Einthoven.

36
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,260
I also have part-time appointments
off at the other side of the world.

37
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,324
For example I am a joint professor at QUT,

38
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:51,560
that"s Queenswood University
of Technology in Brisbane, and

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,360
I am the Scientific Director of a lab in
Moscow at the High School of Economics.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,750
I am also the scientific director of
the data science center at Intel.

41
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,050
So in the last 25 years,
I've been working on these topics.

42
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,660
So I started working more in the area of
modeling and using models toward analysis.

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,340
And in recent years, I've moved more
to data driven types of analysis,

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,970
like process mining,
an essential ingredient for data sites.

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,004
Now I would like to hand
over to Joos Buijs,

46
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:33,039
who will tell you much more about the
practical things, related to this course.

47
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,915
>> Thank you very much Will, so

48
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:39,603
my name is Indie Joos Buijs,
I did my master's here in Angova, and

49
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:44,392
I recently defended my PHD thesis on
process mining also here in Angova.

50
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:49,328
And currently I'm a postdoctoral
researcher in a group of So

51
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,700
a little bit about my hobbies
outside of work and so

52
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,510
I like to watch Pixar movies and
everything involved.

53
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,220
I like to visit theme parks and
one of my reasons,

54
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,070
most recent hobbies is playing with
my eight month old daughter and

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,399
together with my wife and my daughter
explore the world a little bit.

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,170
But this is not about me.

57
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,260
Let's talk about the course.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,220
So in the next couple of slides I'll
explain a little bit more about

59
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,130
the details of the course.

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:21,680
You can also find this in the study
guide and in the grading policy.

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,620
This video is just a brief introduction,
more details are in these documents.

62
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,190
And if there are any, if there's any
inconsistency the documents prevail.

63
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,640
But this is just to get you into the into
the course and what you can expect.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,620
So there are six weeks of video lectures.

65
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,030
Per weeks we have roughly eight
videos of eight to 15 minutes each.

66
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,270
the, several topics that we discuss.

67
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,560
So there's a brief introduction and
general data mining things.

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,950
Then we go into the models and
pros of discovery.

69
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,600
Then in week three you get little
bit of better understanding of

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
the different types of
process models there are.

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,430
This is followed in week four
by more discovery techniques and

72
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,440
also conformance checking techniques.

73
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,004
In week five we look at how you can enrich
the process models, and in week six

74
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:18,828
we discuss operational support and we
also conclude this lecture, this course.

75
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,347
So learning objectives.

76
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:26,790
After this course I hope you see how
process mining fits in the big scheme.

77
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,080
Of all the techniques like simulation,
machine learning machine learning and

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,470
data mining.

79
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:38,220
but, and also we hope that you see what
different aspects process mining entails.

80
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,760
So you can do process discovery,
conformance checking, and

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,414
in the end,
hopefully you can also actually do

82
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:49,328
a process mining project from beginning to
end, including data gathering and such.

83
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,564
In this course you can
get two certificates.

84
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:56,886
So the normal certificate you
get when you have 35 out of

85
00:05:56,886 --> 00:06:01,130
50 points you can get with the week and
the final quiz.

86
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,840
So every week there will be a week quiz
where you can get five points four, and

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,760
there's a final quiz worth 20 points, and
if you get enough points on these quizzes,

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,400
you get the normal certificate.

89
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,540
If you would like to obtain
the certificate with distinction then do,

90
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,960
do these week of final quizzes.

91
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,690
But also do a Tool Quiz where you
experiment with the tools that we use.

92
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,950
And also you have to do a Peer Assignment
which, which I will explain later.

93
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,620
And, if you want to get
the Certificate with Distinction,

94
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,119
you have to earn at least
80 out of 100 points.

95
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,570
So, in more detail that's several quizzes.

96
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,060
So every week there's a week quiz
covering the topics of that week.

97
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,420
Here you can earn five points per quiz.

98
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,500
And a quiz contains of ten
multiple choice questions.

99
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,930
There's no timing, and you get two
attempts and the highest score counts.

100
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,420
At the end of this course
you have a final quiz.

101
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,760
This allows you to earn 20 points.

102
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,030
it, you get 20 multiple choice questions
and there's one timed attempt.

103
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,420
Then if you want to go to, for
the certificate with distinction you

104
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,300
have a tool quiz worth 10 points,
which is an untimed quiz of 20 questions.

105
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,950
Then next to this is a peer assignment.

106
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,400
You can earn 40 points.

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,380
It will start end of week three
early week four, and the goal is to

108
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,300
write a process mining report using one
of the data sets that we will provide.

109
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,180
We will also proved a report template
in Boleta and Word document.

110
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,210
And you can use this to analyze
the data and write your findings.

111
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,780
Then you have to submit it.

112
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,440
And then you have to also evaluate
three other reports using criteria that

113
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,500
we provide.

114
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,290
And in a similar way,

115
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,600
your report is evaluated by three
peers based on the same criteria.

116
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,820
For the peer assignment,
you can use these two tools.

117
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,430
So on the one hand we
have the ProM framework.

118
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,040
This is an academic tool, with many
plug-ins and model types supported.

119
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,650
It started here at this University, but

120
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,490
many researchers and practitioners from
around the globe have contributed to it.

121
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,110
And you can obtain it at
the processmining.org web site.

122
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,880
On the other end, you have Disco,
which is a commercial tool.

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,840
It's simple, fast and easy and
it mainly supports fuzzy models.

124
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,000
And in another video I'll
explain more about Disco, but

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,994
you can install it from fluxicon.com.

126
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,660
Next to this we have also a forum,
please use this to ask for

127
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,970
any help and
report issues that you have with tools.

128
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,340
So use this to discuss any things or

129
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,080
insights that you've gained
also with fellow students.

130
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,250
Even also use this to arrange meetups so
arrange a local meetup

131
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,070
where you'll meet with other students
to discuss things in person.

132
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,160
We will monitor this forum, so

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,630
we hope that you among yourself start
a discussion and answer the questions.

134
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,570
But three of our PhDs in this group and
myself will monitor this.

135
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,630
So Eduardo, Shengnan, and

136
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,520
Maikel will answer any questions
that are remain, that remain open.

137
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,970
And I will also have a look on the forum.

138
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,180
So please use the forum to
kind of meet each other.

139
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,160
The scores is mainly based on
the process mining book, so in,

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,080
at the end of each video, we'll, we'll
point out which chapter we were covered.

141
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,730
Some chapters will be provided to you for
free.

142
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,639
But you can buy the whole
book either physical or

143
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,385
digital, using a discount
kindly offered by Springer.

144
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:43,825
Only for
students participating in this MOOC.

145
00:09:43,825 --> 00:09:47,759
Well that's it from the more
organizational side

146
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,178
I really encourage you
to watch all the videos,

147
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:56,190
learn all the tools that we have so
can analyze your own data.

148
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,540
But please be aware this is
only the tip of the iceberg.

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,720
For each technique that is discussed, we
did a lot of reasearch, and there's a lot

150
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,210
of mu, more detail available in scientific
papers that you can, find online.

151
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,120
So if you find something that you want to
learn more about outside of this book,

152
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,030
then please, look online, and there's much
more knowledge that we can share with you.

153
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,340
So, to conclude to this
introductionary lecture have a lot of

154
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,440
fun in the coming six weeks.

155
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,850
Watch the videos, make the quizzes.

156
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,328
Do the assignment.

157
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,855
And I hope to meet you
a little bit on the forum.

158
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,289
Have fun.

159
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:43,289
