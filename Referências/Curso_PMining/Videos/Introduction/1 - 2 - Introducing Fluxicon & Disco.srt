2
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:08,027
Hi there.

3
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:09,827
I'm Anne Rozinat from Fluxicon, and

4
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:12,480
I would like to welcome you
to this process mining MOOC.

5
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:16,122
Process mining is a very
interesting topic.

6
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:18,950
Very relevant for today's organizations.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,225
Based on just data you can
automatically discover processes.

8
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:26,981
And this can be done very fast and
very quickly and for

9
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:30,440
many different processes
in these organizations.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,600
There are so many processes and
so much data is around.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Well, process mining is already picking
up in several companies nowadays,

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,650
and those companies who are using it,
they get lots of value out of it and

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,270
are expanding their usage.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,060
But many more companies will start
using process mining in the future and

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,080
will become an indispensable tool for
process analysts, process managers, and

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,790
auditors, and, and
many other process roles.

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,450
So, it's not just a very interesting
topic that you chose, but

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,390
also a very relevant one.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,290
And, there's no better person
to learn process mining from

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,675
than professor Bill Finoust, who is also
called the godfather of process mining.

21
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:09,320
Well, as for

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,040
us at Fluxicon, we caught the process
mining back more than ten years ago.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,830
When we were still studying in Germany we
came across this topic and then we went to

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,210
Eindhoven to do PhD in the process mining
group of And this was a really great time.

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,450
Well, first of all,

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,400
lots of other colleagues also working
on different process mining topics, but

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,580
also we had the chance to work with
industry partners such as and Phillips.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,150
And in those projects
what we learned first of

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,870
all is that the processes were
really much more complex.

30
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,870
And we had the chance to develop
our algorithms to meet those,

31
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,045
yeah, complex processes in the real world.

32
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:52,970
Back then most things were really
just working based on toy examples.

33
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,920
So for example, the fuzzy miner was one
of the first algorithms that, yeah,

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,550
really was able to deal with very
complex and heterogeneous processes.

35
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,940
So that was one thing.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,890
But, at the same time, what we notice is
that people were always really amazed and

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,580
enthusiastic about what we could show
them when we took their data and

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,520
made their processes visible for them.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,170
They couldn't believe
that that was possible.

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,510
So there was this huge gap between
what we were able to do, and

41
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,550
what they thought were possible, or what
they were doing in their everyday life.

42
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,200
So, for
us that was the trigger that we said,

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,940
well we have to do something with it.

44
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,990
And we started Fluxicon as
a company to make business, yeah,

45
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,768
process mining software for
business users.

46
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:42,009
and, yeah, with the goal to really
make this technology accessible to

47
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,660
businesses around the world.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,170
And well, when we started out we
just started doing consulting for

49
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,770
Jake's with prom, and
the academic tool set.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,710
yeah, under, under, under our arms,

51
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,390
which we knew very well because we
had developed large parts of it.

52
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,620
And we learned what kind
of questions people had and

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,770
what kind of problems they wanted
to solve with process mining.

54
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,195
And then, we started developing
our own software [COUGH] to,

55
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:14,095
to address those needs and
to kind of build the perfect tool for

56
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:17,860
those business users that
we met in those projects.

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,025
So, this is what Disco is about,
Disco stands for discovery.

58
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:27,051
And Disco it's on the market now for,
yeah, since 2012.

59
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:30,277
And [COUGH].

60
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:34,743
So, our prom is really a great academic
tool set, which makes it very easy for

61
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:37,994
our researchers develop,
to develop new algorithms.

62
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:41,592
For example, Disco's really meant for
a business professional,

63
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:45,819
who does not need to know anything about
how these algorithms works, work, and

64
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:48,310
how the technology looks
like under the hood.

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,780
We have hidden that away from them.

66
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,770
But we make it available for them, so
that based on their domain knowledge and

67
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,540
process knowledge, they can yeah,
use these results and

68
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,610
draw the right conclusions and
interpretations from it.

69
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,010
Now with Disco,
process mining becomes really easy.

70
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,947
You have an Excel sheet for
example, with some data, and

71
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:14,150
you can sim, simply import the CSV or
Excel sheet in a visual way,

72
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,450
map the different columns to
case ID activity name and

73
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,080
time stamp, and then once you import you
are directly taken into the process map.

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,159
You can interactively determine the level
of detail that you want to look at

75
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,425
the process map.

76
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:32,065
And then you can interactively very
easily answer different questions about

77
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,930
the process through filters.

78
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,440
For example, performance filter that
focuses on the long running cases,

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,101
taking longer than an expected time.

80
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:46,370
And focus in on those bottlenecks
that you can then find and

81
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,550
see where things are really
taking very long in the process.

82
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,190
Now, you can even animate that process in
a, in a very easy way, and this brings

83
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,030
the process to life, and helps a lot in
communicating the problems at hand and, so

84
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,120
that people can point their finger on
the place where the problem occurs, and

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,470
discuss why this is happening,
and what they can do about it.

86
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,075
Now [COUGH].

87
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:15,688
well, with as a participant of this MOOC,
we make Disco available for

88
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:19,820
you for the time of the MOOC
with a training license.

89
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,300
You can use this license to import
data sets up to 1 million records.

90
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,780
And this is enough to do
all the exercises, but

91
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,650
you can also import some of
your own data if you have any.

92
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,410
And in fact,
we would encourage you to do that.

93
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,300
Because there's no better way to learn
about process mining than to, yeah,

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,400
to play around with some
of your own data and

95
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,220
to get a good understanding of what it
can really do for your own business.

96
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,370
And yeah.

97
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,000
So we really hope this will spread the,
the, the knowledge about this

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,290
technology which still very few people
know about, that it even exists.

99
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,640
And yeah, I just want to mention also that
we have an academic initiative with close

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,250
to 200 universities all around the world
where we provide lecture materials and

101
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,920
also free academic licenses.

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,630
So you can take a look at our website
to find more about it as well.

103
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,930
Now I would like you to realize that
process mining is really a very special

104
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,100
yeah, data science technique or
data analytics technique because yeah.

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,864
Most of those other data
analytics techniques they make

106
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,521
assumptions about the process.

107
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,641
Or, if you think of, for example BI,

108
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:35,690
business intelligence technology, you
have to set up an implementation project.

109
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,230
And it's all very heavyweight.

110
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,908
With process mining you just need to
get some data and you can start mining.

111
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:44,590
It's very lightweight and very powerful.

112
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,430
But, what is especially
interesting about process mining,

113
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,990
is what it makes possible for
the business user.

114
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,510
So, let's take a look at this graph.

115
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,830
Well, the business users what they have
access to typically is, well first of all,

116
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,370
specific reports and dashboards that
are made specifically for them.

117
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,710
They're very accessible for them,
but it's also kind of limited,

118
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,350
because those reports they include exactly
that kind of information that was pre-pro,

119
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,790
programmed for them to contain.

120
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,760
Well, Excel, on the other hand is a very

121
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,460
popular tool among professionals
not without reason.

122
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,720
Excel is a very powerful tool, and
you can do lots of things with it.

123
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,989
And it's something that the,
the business user can use themselves.

124
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,880
On the other end of the spectrum, you
have those data science techniques that

125
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,090
everyone talks about today
in the big data craze.

126
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,970
And well, that's,
those techniques are very powerful but

127
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,470
at the same time you really need to be
an engineer or a specialist to use them.

128
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,380
Now process mining,

129
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,820
on the other hand, is particularly
interesting because it's very powerful.

130
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,375
It's much more powerful for

131
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:56,300
analyzing processes than Excel, because
processes consist of multiple steps, and

132
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,645
that's a thing that's very
difficult to do in Excel.

133
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,800
But it's still accessible for
the business user.

134
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,620
So the business user who has the knowledge
about their business process and

135
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,850
about the problems in the process,
they can use process mining yeah,

136
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,125
in their own hands to really yeah,
get great results based on that analysis.

137
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,791
And so,
if you think that process mining is

138
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:25,173
just a way to automate something
that was being done manually before.

139
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:29,178
Like previously we were modeling
processes, manually modeling them by hand,

140
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,290
now we can do it automatically
with process mining.

141
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,680
That falls way too short.

142
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,960
Process mining can do much more than that.

143
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,580
And in a way, you can compare it with
spreadsheets because when, before

144
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,200
spreadsheets were around, people had to do
everything manually using a calculator.

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,100
So if you wanted to do a projection or

146
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,360
some kind of forecast, you had to type it
in and you had to manually calculate it.

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,070
But once spreadsheets were around,

148
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,200
it's not just that the things that you
did manually before those could now,

149
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,910
now be automated, but
much more things could be done.

150
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,160
Many more things could be done.

151
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,600
And yeah, so
it gave you much more power to do

152
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,970
all kinds of things that nobody
thought about were possible before.

153
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,410
Process mining works in the same way for
processors.

154
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,070
And is as revolutionary as
spreadsheets for, for numbers.

155
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,220
So, for business professionals,
who have the knowledge to

156
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,630
draw the right interpretation and make the
right decisions based on those results,

157
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,466
process mining really brings
kind of special powers to them.

158
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:34,060
So we kind of, that's how we like
to see our, our Disco users also,

159
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,030
that we can now give them super powers for
their own processes.

160
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,544
Well I'm really glad you're
participating in this MOOC.

161
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:46,390
I would like to welcome you to
the process mining community and

162
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,290
I'm sure you will love this
topic as much as we do.

163
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,186
And happy mining.

164
00:09:51,186 --> 00:10:01,186
