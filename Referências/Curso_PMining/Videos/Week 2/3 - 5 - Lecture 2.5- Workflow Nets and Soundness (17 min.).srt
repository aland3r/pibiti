00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,980
Welcome to this lecture of the course of
process mining data science in action.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,700
Today we will focus on the class
of process models having a clear

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,220
start and end.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,390
Traces in an event log correspond to
process instances of such models.

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,040
On this slide,
you see an example of a Workflow Net.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,000
This is a Petri net that has
a well-defined start place and

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,510
a well-defined end place.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,430
Moreover, it should be free of obvious
problems like livelocks and deadlocks.

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,929
And later we will introduce
the notion of soundness.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,340
Traces in a log need to go from
the initial state to the final state.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,020
So, this is a class of models
that is not only used for

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,660
process mining, but is also widely used
in the area of workflow management and

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,880
business process management.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,900
So let's take a step back.

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,410
Business process management, BPM.

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,930
What is this?

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,670
This is the linking pin between IT and
management science.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,330
And it has a long tradition.

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,950
The main goal is to ensure efficiency.

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,690
Already in the 18th century, Adam Smith
showed that by the division of labor,

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,670
you could make processes
more efficient and cheaper.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,080
Taylor introduced
scientific management.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,230
Henry Ford, we all know introduced
the notion of mass production,

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,430
when he made the T-Ford.

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,890
But the greatest breakthrough that we find
if we look at business process management,

27
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,970
how to make things more efficient,

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,400
started in the 1950s when information
systems and computers became omnipresent.

29
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,880
Currently, we can see a new wave.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,720
Tremendous amounts of data are available.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,420
So we can take BPM to the next
level where data is the new oil.

32
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,710
This is a variant of
the well-known BPM lifecycle.

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,978
If you look at the small
circle in the middle,

34
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:26,968
you can see that a BPM project,
if you want to make processes better,

35
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:31,204
more efficient, starts with a design or
redesign phase.

36
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,501
Then you implement or

37
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:37,700
configure an information system based
on the processes you have designed.

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,420
And then you run these processes, and
maybe you need to adjust them on the fly.

39
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,480
If you look at this well-known BPM
lifecycle from an analysis perspective,

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,725
you can look at model-based analysis,
which you use mostly in the design or

41
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,240
re-design phase.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,440
And you can look at data-based analysis.

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,880
And process mining is typically focusing
on the red part in this diagram.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,390
Learning from processes
while they are running.

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,260
So, what is the role of processes in BPM,
or work flow management.

46
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,710
First of all, process models
are used to reason about processes.

47
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,230
Where are the bottle necks?

48
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,740
How can we make things cheaper?

49
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,530
But models are also used inside processes.

50
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,900
For example, to support decisions.

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,390
Like will I accept this claim or not?

52
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,730
Here you see a list of typical ways
that process models may be used.

53
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,200
To discuss responsibilities and
bottlenecks.

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,130
To analyze compliance.

55
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,980
To predict possible problems in
the future using simulation.

56
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,620
And last but not least,
to configure information systems.

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,720
For example using workflow or
BPM technology.

58
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,530
Unfortunately, many models
are being used in practice.

59
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,190
Here you see a picture of the Tower of
Babel, indicating that there are so

60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,040
many languages and
that sometimes it is a bit confusing.

61
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,100
In this course we will see several
different process modeling languages but I

62
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,650
would like to stress that the differences
between these languages are minimal.

63
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,550
They're all based on the same concept.

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,520
Here you see three types of process
models that one frequently sees.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,020
The top shows the so called BPMN model.

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,360
The Business Process Model and
Notation that expresses

67
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
behavior of cases starting in initial
state, leading to some final state.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,187
Below that you see a so-called
Event-Driven Process Chain, and

69
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,895
this is the notation typically used
in the context of systems like SAP.

70
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:57,290
At the bottom you see Petri nets,
and today we will focus on

71
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,890
a particular variant of Petri nets,
namely workflow nets.

72
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,340
The representations look different,
but they all try to express the same

73
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,910
phenomena, and in the end they
all generate traces of events.

74
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,290
We can all record event logs for these
types of processes if they are executed.

75
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,720
We've already seen a lot of Petri nets.

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,490
We know that they
are composed of places and

77
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,650
transitions and arcs and
tokens are flowing through them.

78
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,710
We've seen that before.

79
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,560
So here you see an example run,
just to refresh our mind a bit.

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,860
So, from the initial state with the token
on the start place, we can execute

81
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,520
different activities through firing
transitions until we reach the end.

82
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,400
So, this is one of many
possible firing sequences.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,240
Before, we also saw the notion of a
reachability graph and a transition system.

84
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,400
So the Petri net shown here
generates this transition system,

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,630
which captures all the behavior.

86
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,210
And the trace that I just showed you, is
one path through this transition system.

87
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,900
So let's now focus on the question,
if we have a workflow net,

88
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,370
so a model with a start place and
an end place, is it a good model?

89
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,640
So here you see an example,
and please think about this.

90
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,270
Is this a good process model?

91
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,850
If you look carefully,

92
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,040
you will see that that is not the case,
because there is a possible deadlock.

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,430
If we take the loop back, we may end up
in the situation with just a token at c3

94
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,040
which corresponds to a deadlock.

95
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,310
Let's take a look at
another process model.

96
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,370
Again, take a minute to
look at this model, and

97
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,040
try to tell whether this
model is a good model or not.

98
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,920
If you look closely, you will see that in
the beginning there is an AND-split, but

99
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,820
it doesn't really
correspond to an AND-join.

100
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,650
So, again, we see that there is a problem.

101
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,284
And if you draw the reachability
graph of this model,

102
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:13,795
you will see that this doesn't have
the behavior that you expect it to have.

103
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:18,010
Let's take a look at another
variant of the same process.

104
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,080
Is this a good model?

105
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,818
It doesn't have the problems
that we have seen before, but

106
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:32,340
there is another problem in this model,
that the task pay compensation,

107
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,020
which is modeled by the transition
at the end, can never be fired.

108
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,960
It's dead.

109
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,620
You can never reach the state where
both of the input places are marked.

110
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,570
Let's take a look at another model.

111
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,670
So, carefully look at this model.

112
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,590
Is this a correct process model?

113
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,640
In terms that it doesn't have any of
the anomalies that we discussed before.

114
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,700
Yes, it has all the desired properties.

115
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,680
But one may ask yourself,
why is this a good model?

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,740
What is the criterion that we are using?

117
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,550
Well the criterion that we
are using is soundness, and

118
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,250
it is defined on top of WorkFlow
nets that we already introduced.

119
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,616
So a WorkFlow net has one start place,
one end place,

120
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:25,830
and all the transitions and all the places
are on a path from start to end.

121
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,140
Based on this,
we can define the notion of soundness.

122
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,620
A WorkFlow net is sound if and only if
the following four properties hold.

123
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,090
The first property expresses
that places should be safe.

124
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,800
At most, one token should be at
a place at any point in time.

125
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,500
There should be proper completion,
meaning that the moment we

126
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,930
put a token on the end place,
all other places should be empty.

127
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,040
We should have the option to complete.

128
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,820
No matter what we do, we should
always be able to reach the state,

129
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,500
the marking,
with just a token on the final place.

130
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,740
And last but not least,
there should not be any dead parts.

131
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,890
So all the parts of the process model
should potentially be activated.

132
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,460
So there should be scenarios
where they play a role.

133
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,440
So these are the four minimal
requirements that any WorkFlow net should

134
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,700
satisfy in order to be sound.

135
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,210
So let's take again a look
at several examples, and

136
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,890
try to see whether these models
satisfy these four properties.

137
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,680
So here we see again,

138
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,970
a process model, does it satisfy these
four properties, making it sound?

139
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,370
The answer is no.

140
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,390
The rows highlighted here in green,
correspond to properties that hold for

141
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,980
this particular model.

142
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,021
But we also see two properties,
proper completion and

143
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,210
option to complete, that do not hold.

144
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,375
And we can see that, because the state
that is now indicated by the red tokens,

145
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,269
is a reachable state, and from this state,

146
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,910
we can no longer go to the situation
where there's just a token on p6.

147
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:20,380
Let's take a look at another example.

148
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,580
Is this model sound?

149
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,400
Again we can look at
its reachability graph,

150
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,200
look at the traces that it generates.

151
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
And if we do that,

152
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,810
we see that only the last property,
absence of deadlock parts, holds.

153
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,210
All the other properties
are not satisfied.

154
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,100
Well, it's easy to see,
because once you put the token in p3,

155
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,300
transition t3 can fire any number of
times, and there is no way that you

156
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,260
can remove these tokens and
go back to the final state.

157
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,930
Yeah,

158
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,510
so it's clear that these
properties are violated.

159
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,170
If we take a look at this model.

160
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,980
Again, think about it.

161
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,770
Is this model sound or not?

162
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,360
Then you see that the top three properties
hold, but transition t3 is dead.

163
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,600
It cannot be executed.

164
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,740
So it's not a sound model.

165
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,190
Now we can take a look
at this model again.

166
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,379
Again, we can check whether it's sound,
and in this case,

167
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,440
we can see that all the four properties
are satisfied, making the model sound.

168
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,570
So on these toy examples it is very
easy to see whether things are sound or

169
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,820
not, but
in general it's much more difficult.

170
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,989
But there are good analysis techniques
to check soundness of such models.

171
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,130
Let's take a look at some more examples.

172
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,080
So, this shows a WorkFlow
net that is not safe.

173
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,420
So it's not sound because one of the four
properties is being violated, and

174
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
you can see the markings
here that can be reached.

175
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,530
So it's not sound.

176
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,770
This is another more tricky example
where there is no option to complete

177
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,670
because we can reach the
the state with just a token in place c3.

178
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,410
So then decision is not enabled, and

179
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,430
we get stuck somewhere in
the middle of the process.

180
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,640
So again it is not sound.

181
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,490
So, if we look at these properties,

182
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,630
you may have noticed that the option
to complete implies proper completion.

183
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,770
So in other words, if proper
completion does not hold, so there

184
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,260
is a token on the final place, but still
something is remaining in the process.

185
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,460
If it does not hold, then also
the option to complete does not hold.

186
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,420
And it's easy to see, because the only
way that a token in the middle of

187
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,960
this cloud can disappear is
to go to the final place, but

188
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,300
then there would be two
tokens in this final place.

189
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,357
So, if we have the option to complete,
we automatically have proper completion.

190
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,128
So when checking the model,

191
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:10,260
we don't need to look at proper completion
because it holds automatically.

192
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,620
There is a logical connection between the
Petri net properties that we have seen in

193
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,810
earlier lectures, and

194
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,030
the property of soundness that we
are looking at in this lecture.

195
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,136
So this is a Petri net, a WorkFlow net.

196
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:33,450
We can short-circuit it by adding
a transition from the final

197
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,860
part of the process to
the initial part of the process.

198
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,050
So in other words, when we reach the end,
we go back to the beginning.

199
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,240
This is the so-called
short-circuited WorkFlow net.

200
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,940
And we have the very nice property net
that a WorkFlow net is sound, if and

201
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,290
only if the corresponding short-circuited
Petri net is live and bounded.

202
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,340
If we also want to have safety, the first
property, it should also be safe.

203
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:06,240
But boundedness is sufficient
for the next three activities.

204
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,640
So what are the main types
of model-based analysis?

205
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,660
At a higher level we can
distinguish two types of analysis.

206
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,228
verification, like the soundness
checks we just discussed.

207
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,918
Performance analysis,

208
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:28,410
often using techniques like simulation or
Markov analysis.

209
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,410
These are the typical types
of analysis that people do

210
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,420
when they talk about
business process management.

211
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,470
However, just looking at
the models is not sufficient.

212
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:47,160
All these analysis techniques,
they rely on the quality of the model.

213
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,490
The model has to represent reality
properly, otherwise any

214
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,230
analysis result doesn't have any value.

215
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,200
Whereas if we look in practice,
often the model that people make by hand,

216
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,030
have a poor alignment with reality,
making the conclusions very unreliable.

217
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,680
So process mining aims to address
this problem by establishing a very

218
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,740
tight connection between models and
the actual event data.

219
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,830
In the next lecture,

220
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:29,540
we will really start talking about
concrete process mining algorithms.

221
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,980
In this case a discovery technique.

222
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,610
We will talk in the next lecture
about the Alpha Algorithm.

223
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,090
The goal of the Alpha Algorithm
is to discover WorkFlow nets.

224
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,450
So the types of process models
that we have discussed in this

225
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,520
lecture from event logs.

226
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,070
So we start from an event log,
as a multiset of traces, and

227
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,120
from this multiset of traces, we try to

228
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,920
automatically learn a process model
expressed in terms of a WorkFlow net.

229
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,710
And you can see an example here.

230
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,300
In the last couple of lectures we have
been talking about many things related to

231
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,480
process models.

232
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,640
So chapter two is the central chapter
where all of these things will

233
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,100
be discussed.

234
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,289
Thank you for watching this lecture and
hope to see you in the next lecture.
