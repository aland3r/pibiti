00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:12,160
Welcome to this lecture of the course on
process mining, data science in action.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,340
Now that you are able to read and
create petri nets,

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:20,029
we start looking at properties like
deadlocks, liveness and boundedness.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,430
What you see on this slide
is the reachability graph,

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,070
of the Petri net that we
have been showing before.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,340
One can think of a reachability graph as
a transition system of a particular type,

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,140
having one specific initial state,
being the initial marking.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,130
So this is a finite reachability graph,
but a Petri net

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,340
may also have a corresponding reachability
graph that is infinitely large.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,230
So here the number of tokens in Petri,
is unbounded.

12
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,970
It can grow to any number by
just executing the cycle t1, t2.

13
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,450
So the reachability graph is infinite.

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,530
Having reachability graphs
that are infinitely large,

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,290
triggers the interesting
question of boundedness.

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,050
So a place is called k-bounded,
if there is no

17
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,800
reachable marking where there are more
than k tokens in this particular place.

18
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:31,110
If all the places of a Petri net are
k-bounded, then we say that the Petri net,

19
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,754
as a whole, is k-bounded.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,770
We also say that the Petri net is
bounded if there exists such a k.

21
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,420
So if you take a look at this example,
one can see that p1 is two bounded,

22
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,850
p2 is also two bounded,
but p3 is unbounded.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,140
So let's take a look at this
model in a bit more detail.

24
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,510
So p1 is 2-bounded.

25
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,640
Why is it 2-bounded?

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,930
Because the total number
of tokens in p1 and

27
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,820
p2 together can never
grow into more than two.

28
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,230
Only a token can disappear from
these two places by executing t3.

29
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,110
So two is an upper bound.

30
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,000
The same holds for p2.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,485
p3, on the other hand, is unbounded,
because if we execute t1,

32
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:33,028
t2, t1, t2,
we can get any number of tokens in p3.

33
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:41,553
So the whole petri net is
unbounded because p3 is unbounded.

34
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:46,439
Safeness, is a particular
type of boundedness it is

35
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,775
boundedeness where k is equal to one.

36
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:55,440
If all the places never have a two or
more tokens, we call it a safe Petri net.

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,440
So if we take a look at
this example that we

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,150
have seen before then this Petri
net having this initial marking

39
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,070
is a safe Petri net because none of the
places can ever have two or more tokens.

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,690
If we take a look at this initial marking,
on the other hand,

41
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,500
we will see that the Petri net is
still bounded having this initial

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,660
marking, but it is not safe anymore.

43
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,880
It is now too bounded, and
if you carefully take a look at

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,990
the Petri net, you will see that it
is possible to put two tokens in x.

45
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,550
So x is two bounded but is not safe.

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,850
So that was the property of boundedness.

47
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,040
Now let's take a look at
the property of deadlock.

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,828
So, we say that a marking is dead
if no transition is enabled in it.

49
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,217
We say that the Petri net
has a potential deadlock,

50
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:06,565
if there is a reachable marking that
is dead where nothing can happen.

51
00:04:06,565 --> 00:04:11,640
So a deadlock-free Petri net, for

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,330
any reachable state,
it enables at least one transition.

53
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,600
So let's now take a look at the example.

54
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,360
Example that I showed before.

55
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,730
This example has many deadlocks.

56
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,560
And here you see
a visualisation of one of them.

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,210
We can go through the loop t1,
t2 as many times as we want, but

58
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,370
the moment that we execute t3,
we end up in a deadlock.

59
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,290
So there are many
possible dead locks here.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,370
So let's take a look at some example petri
nets and try to look at whether they

61
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,570
are dead lock free or not and
whether they are unbounded or not.

62
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,700
So, this petri net,
what kind of properties does it have.

63
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,790
Think a bit about it.

64
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,940
Okay.

65
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,000
So if we look at this Petri net and
we think of possible initial markings,

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,110
then this is a possible initial marking,

67
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,310
such that the Petri net is unbounded and
not deadlock-free.

68
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,540
So what we see is that we can go through
the loop as many times as we want,

69
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,100
put any number of tokens in p3.

70
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,320
So it is unbounded, but

71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,790
it has a deadlock because the moment
we execute t3, we get stuck.

72
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,630
Another initial marking is the initial
marking that you see here.

73
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,060
Now there is only a token in p3.

74
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,790
So that means that none of
the transitions is enabled.

75
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:51,450
So the initial marking is already
a deadlock, but the model is now bounded.

76
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,150
Now one can start looking for
models, that don't have a deadlock.

77
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,540
That was part of the question.

78
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,600
Such models do not exist, because in this
Petri net, any initial marking that you

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,130
choose will have a deadlock.

80
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,210
Because by executing t3,
you can remove all

81
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,940
the tokens from the loop involving p1 and
p2, ending up in a deadlock.

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,970
Let's take a look at
the traffic light example, but

83
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,100
now without an initial marking.

84
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,830
Please, try to provide an initial marking
such that we see all combinations of being

85
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:40,730
bounded or not, bounded, deadlock-free or
not being deadlock-free.

86
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,680
Do all of these Petri nets exist?

87
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,860
Well, let's take a look at some examples.

88
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,220
So this is an initial marking

89
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,420
where the resulting Petri net
is bounded and deadlock-free.

90
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,710
This, in fact, is the state that
we have seen many times before.

91
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,350
This is another initial marking
that is immediately a deadlock so

92
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,450
the initial marking no transition
is enabled, so it is bounded, but

93
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,240
it is definitely not deadlock-free.

94
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,600
Because the initial marking
is already a deadlock.

95
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,150
Now we can start looking for

96
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,710
initial markings where
the resulting model is unbounded.

97
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,230
But in this case,
such a marking does not exist.

98
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:34,600
Because the total number of
tokens will always be limited,

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,390
no matter what initial marking we choose.

100
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,360
So after explaining what

101
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,790
a deadlock is,
we look at a more difficult property.

102
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,930
And that's the property of liveness.

103
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,130
So liveness can be defined as follows.

104
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,230
A transition is live if
from any reachable marking

105
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,570
it is possible to reach a marking
that enables this transition.

106
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,468
So, no matter what you do you can
fire any sequence of transitions

107
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:16,140
it is always possible to go back to
some marking where t is enabled.

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,000
So then we call a transition live.

109
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,870
A Petri net as a whole is live
if all transitions are live.

110
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,200
What is a logical consequence
of liveness is that if

111
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,980
a Petri net is live by definition,
it will al so be deadlock-free.

112
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,530
However, the reverse does not hold.

113
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,290
A petri net that is deadlock-free
does not have to be live.

114
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,500
And you can see an example
already on this slide.

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,601
If we look at this initial marking,
than in this initial marking,

116
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:55,330
the transitions corresponding to
traffic light one are all live.

117
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,409
And the transitions corresponding
to the second traffic light,

118
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,900
they are all not live.

119
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,160
They can never be executed.

120
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,610
So this is an example of a Petri net
that is deadlock free, but that is not live.

121
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:18,310
Showing that a live Petri net
is always deadlock free but

122
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,740
the reverse does not have to hold.

123
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,730
Liveness is a difficult property.

124
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,130
So, to illustrate this a bit further,
one can look at this diagram.

125
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,240
The blue dot indicates initial marking.

126
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:38,219
From the initial marking,
we can follow any sequence of activities.

127
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,340
Then we end up in the red marking.

128
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,100
What liveness now says is that no matter
what state we have reached, so no matter

129
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:56,060
what red marking we look at, it's
always possible from such a red marking

130
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,830
to go back to the space of markings
that are indicated by the green oval.

131
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,110
Where transition t is enabled.

132
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,950
In other words,

133
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,160
no matter what you do, it is always
possible to enable this transition.

134
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,460
If that property holds for

135
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,870
all transitions,
we say that the petri net is live.

136
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,680
So, now we get into more complicated and
also a bit artificial

137
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,720
petri nets but they let you think
about what is property x lead means.

138
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,950
So if we take a look at this
petri net is it bounded,

139
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,390
is it safe, is it deadlock free,
is it live.

140
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,480
Try to answer these questions for
this particular petri net.

141
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,510
Here is the answer.

142
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,450
The Petri net is not bounded,
because if we go through the cycle t1,

143
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,370
t2, t3, t1, t2, t3 we can repeat that as

144
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:03,920
many times as we want and in every round,
we put an additional token in p4.

145
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,200
So, p4 is unbounded, so by definition,
the Petri net cannot be safe.

146
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,070
Then the question is, is the,
Petri net deadlock free?

147
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,380
Well if you look carefully you can see
that the initial marking that is shown

148
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,800
here you can execute t1 and
then immediately execute transition t4.

149
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,280
Then you get stuck in the state
with just the token and t2.

150
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,350
So this is a deadlock.

151
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,930
So because there is a deadlock,
definitely the Petri net is not live.

152
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,640
Let's take a look at another example.

153
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,600
Again we have the same questions.

154
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,800
Is this Petri net in this particular
initial marking, is it bounded,

155
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,460
safe, deadlock free, and or live?

156
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,950
Again.

157
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,770
Think about what the answer
to this question is.

158
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,830
The answer is that the Petri
net is bounded but not safe.

159
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,640
And you can easily see that.

160
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,460
In the initial marking,
you can already execute t1, putting

161
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,020
a second token in p4, so
p4 is not safe, but it is two bounded

162
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,320
because there is no way of ever putting
more than two tokens in p4,

163
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,920
because in every round we add
the token and we again remove it.

164
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,330
The second question was, is the Petri
net deadlock-free, and, or, live.

165
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,450
Well, the Petri net is deadlock-free,
but it is not live.

166
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:51,260
You can see that if t5 occurs, then you
remove a token from this outer circle,

167
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,670
thereby not allowing the system to
go again through the cycle, t1,

168
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,780
t2, t3, et cetera.

169
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,170
So, t5 will disable behavior, but

170
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,990
there will always be a token in p4,
so t4 will always be enabled.

171
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,790
So this is another example of a situation
where the model is deadlock-free,

172
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,540
but not live.

173
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,660
If this is not clear to you, please try
to draw the reachability graph, and

174
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,490
you will see that these
properties are actually the case.

175
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,200
So, the reachability graph is
a special kind of transition system.

176
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,060
Firing sequences of
the petri net correspond to

177
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,990
path in the transition system.

178
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,420
The transition system is composed
of states and transitions.

179
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,310
So the states correspond to markings,
the transitions corresponds to

180
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,840
the transitions in the petri net but
in a reachability graph,

181
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,440
many transitions can refer to
the same transition in the Petri net.

182
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,310
Whereas in the Petri net, we only have
one transition with the same label.

183
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,780
In a transition system there may be one or

184
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,739
more initial states, and
zero or more final states.

185
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,020
This is more general than a Petri net
where we always have one initial marking,

186
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,500
and we really do not
talk about final states.

187
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,260
But these final states are important
if we talk about process mining.

188
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,970
In this particular example you see
a model that has one initial state and

189
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:36,533
has two final states, as indicated.

190
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:40,930
So, if we understand what a transition
system is that may have multiple initial

191
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,540
states and multiple final states we can
define the notion of complete traces.

192
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,270
So complete traces go from
the initial state to the final state.

193
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:56,970
So we only consider cases that go from
the initial state to the final state,

194
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,070
to one of the final states.

195
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,920
So this is an example of a complete trace.

196
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,250
So we execute a.

197
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,920
Then we do g once for a second time.

198
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,330
Then we do c, and then we do e.

199
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:14,910
So this goes from the initial state
to one of the final states.

200
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,599
This is another complete trace.

201
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,080
This is an example.

202
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,940
a and then four g's,
is an incomplete trace because we

203
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,510
are in state s2 and did not yet
reach one of the final states.

204
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,380
So it's an incomplete trace.

205
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,589
bf is another example
of an incomplete trace.

206
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,350
So a transition system,
may have infinitely many states, but

207
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,030
even if we look at the finer
transition system,

208
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,880
there may be infinitely many complete or
incomplete traces.

209
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,140
In this case, the transition system is
finite, but because of the loop involving

210
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,320
g, we can have infinitely many traces,
being complete or not.

211
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,360
So, let's take a look at the question.

212
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,520
How many complete traces are there
in this small transition system?

213
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,200
Please think about this.

214
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,140
There are five, complete traces.

215
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,880
And, it's easy to see.

216
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,890
Just replay on the transition system and

217
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,630
you will see that indeed, these are the
five complete traces that are there.

218
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,430
That go from one of the initial
states to one of the final states.

219
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,940
So far we have been talking
about transition systems,

220
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,300
let's now go back to Petri nets and
if we look at Petri nets and

221
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,080
we define Petri nets with a set
of final markings, then we

222
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,690
can convert that into a transition system
that may have multiple final markings.

223
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,430
And here you can see an example
where that is the case.

224
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,230
So let's take a look at this Petri net and
look at this behavior.

225
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,050
So given such a Petri net
with multiple final states,

226
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,489
we can convert it to a transition
system with multiple final states.

227
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,630
And then the behavior of this
process that we have modeled

228
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,870
can be enumerated as a set of traces
that move from one of the initial

229
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,380
states to to one of final states and
in this case these are these four traces.

230
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,420
Transition systems may be exponential
in the size of a Petri net.

231
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,750
And you can see that if you model
concurrency, as you can see here,

232
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,750
the corresponding transition system
will have two to the power k,

233
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,730
where k is the number of transitions

234
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,230
states.

235
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,530
We can also look at the situation where
we have multiple tokens in the place, and

236
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,160
in this case we also have many
more states than we have places.

237
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,760
So if you put 1,000 tokens in,

238
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,329
the input place,
we have 1,001 reachable states.

239
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,930
It's also easy to construct petri nets
that are extremely small that have

240
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,570
infinitely many states.

241
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:26,410
So c is just producing tokens,
and it can produce any number of tokens.

242
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,980
So the size of the petri net

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,660
may be much smaller than the size
of your transition system.

244
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,870
So, please take a look at this example.

245
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,300
And again take a moment to construct
the corresponding transition system.

246
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,940
Note that the final marking is
the marking with the token in p6.

247
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,560
Make the transition system and
then look at all the complete traces.

248
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,070
There is no loop in this model so
it has to be finite.

249
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,790
Okay lets take a look at
the resulting transition system and

250
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,660
then at the set of traces so
given this petri net.

251
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,390
We can construct this transition system.

252
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,730
And it may look quite involved, but

253
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,710
if you systematically look at what
are the states that are reachable and

254
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,400
what kind of transitions are enabled in
the state, this is what you will get.

255
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,050
Once you have this transition system,
you can look at all the paths that

256
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,510
go from the initial state
to the final state.

257
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,780
And these give you the complete traces.

258
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,950
And in this example,
there are 16 complete traces.

259
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,630
And it may be a bit difficult
to see on this slide, so

260
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,800
we can zoom in into a particular trace.

261
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,540
In this case the trace (a,b,d,c,e,f).

262
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:02,590
And we can see this is one of the 16
traces,and indeed it is a path

263
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:07,880
through our reachability graph going from
the initial state to the final state.

264
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,200
So this concludes the introduction
to the topic of Petri net and

265
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,430
the corresponding properties and
also the relation to transition systems.

266
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,940
This will be very important if we
start talking about process discovery.

267
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,973
Thank you for watching and
hope to see you next time.
