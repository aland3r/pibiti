2
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:12,650
Welcome to the last lecture of the course
on Process Mining: Data Science in Action.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,040
Today, we recap the main
ingredients of this course.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,160
Our world is driven by data.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,680
In one of the first lectures,
we discussed the internet of events.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,710
So we can find event data everywhere, and
the challenge is to use it in a good way.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,990
This is a primary task for
the data scientist.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:42,220
So data scientist should know about
statistic, should know about economics and

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,800
all kinds of aspect and
it's very important that such a data

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,890
scientist also knows about processes
because it's not just about static data,

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,100
in the end, you would like to
improve real processes and

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,900
products as they are being
used in the field.

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,380
So therefore, this combination is crucial.

14
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,940
One can see process mining as
something that bridges the gap

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,570
between process oriented techniques and
data oriented techniques.

16
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,160
So business process management, process
modeling and model-based analysis can be

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,980
combined with techniques like data mining,
business intelligence and statistics.

18
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,860
But for this, we need to have new
approaches, new techniques and

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,570
these have been discussed in this course.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,440
One could say well, what's different
from business intelligence?

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,850
But if you would compare it
to business intelligence and

22
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,335
you would view analysis as
seeing a child that has fever,

23
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:51,960
then business intelligence will only be
able to tell you that the child has fever.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,705
You can measure it and
put it in a nice dashboard.

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,160
However, process mining is able to
look inside the process itself.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,670
So, BI is very different from process
mining as we have seen in this course.

27
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,730
Using tools like ProM and Disco and all
kinds of other tools, we are able to look

28
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,030
inside a process by analyzing the event
data that is widely available today.

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,250
If you look at the classical use of
models, it is often used for play out.

30
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,680
You have a model and
you generate behavior from it.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,480
This is what happens if
you're doing simulation or

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,190
if you're using a BPMN system.

33
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,500
In this course, we focused on play-in and
replay, the confrontation between

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,780
models and
data where the actual behavior is leading.

35
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,769
This way, we can relate
process models to event logs.

36
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,770
We started with this very simple
model which identifies three

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,560
types of process mining.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Discovery, which can be seen as play-in.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,660
Learning, a model from event data.

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,080
Conformance checking,
which requires a form of replay.

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,150
By replaying reality on top of the model,

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,990
we can see where reality is different
from the things that have been modeled.

43
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,870
And last but not least, enhancement.

44
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,340
Again, we replay the model, but
now with the purpose of repairing a model,

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,160
improving it, or extending it
with other perspectives like for

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,890
example, bottleneck information.

47
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,180
This is the simple model
that we started with.

48
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:52,630
In later lectures, we extended this
simple model just identifying three types

49
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,080
of process mining into something that
identified ten process mining activities,

50
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,090
but also distinguishing between offline
process mining and online process mining.

51
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,130
Things like operational support,

52
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,120
prediction, recommendation,
detecting deviations as they occur.

53
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,380
This refined process mining framework
also shows other perspectives like time,

54
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,150
resources and data.

55
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,065
These can be connected by using
the control flow backbone.

56
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,030
We also identified the difference
between normative and

57
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,190
descriptive models and
how this fits into this overall framework.

58
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,660
So process mining is much
more than process discovery.

59
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
It's about conformance analysis,

60
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,398
performance analysis,
decision point mining.

61
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:51,760
So if you see that in a process,
there is a part where some of

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,730
the customers go left and
some of the customers go right,

63
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,400
you would like to understand why
there are these differences.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,750
Organizational mining,
which people are doing what?

65
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,870
Which people are most effective
in doing particular things?

66
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,950
Comparative process mining.

67
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,470
For example,
comparing different groups of customers or

68
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,340
comparing different departments to

69
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,760
operational support like things like
predication, recommendation, etc.

70
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,580
But process discovery is
still the starting point and

71
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,630
it is something that is fascinating.

72
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,190
It's extremely useful.

73
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,160
You start from raw event data and

74
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,430
you automatically construct
control flow models.

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,585
It's often challenging, but always
possible, you can always simplify models,

76
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:49,280
spaghetti-like models into simpler models
by looking at the most frequent behavior,

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,670
but it requires expertise, the expertise
that you've learned in this course.

78
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,850
Which algorithm to apply?

79
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,830
What is the effect of using
a particular representational bias?

80
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,770
And we have also seen that it is difficult
because we never know the real process and

81
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:13,170
we only can see positive examples in the
event log that we are using for analysis.

82
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,970
So it's a fascinating area with many
open problems and many opportunities.

83
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
If you do process discovery,
you will find out that

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,370
there are actually multiple forces
that are competing with one another,

85
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,395
fitness versus simplicity,
generalization versus precision.

86
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,300
There are metrics available for

87
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,750
all of these four dimensions, and if you
are using a process discovery technique,

88
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,460
you need to identify how important
are all these different dimensions.

89
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,580
We also discussed tooling.

90
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,600
In this course,
we have been heavily using ProM and

91
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,050
Disco as an example of an academic open
source tool and a commercial tool.

92
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,200
This way you get some feeling of
the available functionality in

93
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,230
existing software.

94
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,610
In this last week, we also looked at
running a process mining project.

95
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,860
We looked at the L * life cycle
model identifying different stages of

96
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,050
a process mining project.

97
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:28,060
We've also seen that if we talk about
processes, there is a spectrum going from

98
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,506
lasagna processes that are highly
structured that we can apply the entire L *

99
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:40,190
life cycle model to spaghetti like
processes which are less structured, more

100
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,520
variable but where the potential value
of process mining can be much higher.

101
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,090
This course was designed around
the book Process Mining: Discovery,

102
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,189
Conformance Checking and
Enhancement of Business Processes.

103
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,570
In the different lectures, we visited
all of the chapters of this book.

104
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,880
Sometimes, we had some excursions
to neighboring fields or

105
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,760
recent developments, but it is a very
good reference for this course.

106
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:17,060
What one should realize
is that in this course,

107
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,640
we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.

108
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,870
There are many more process
mining techniques and

109
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,650
questions possible and available.

110
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,800
And you're encouraged to
visit websites like the

111
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,540
one shown here to explore
this field in more detail.

112
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,470
We are now coming to
a conclusion of this course on

113
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,090
Process Mining: Data Science in Action.

114
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,160
You should realize that there
are opportunities everywhere.

115
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,570
There is event data everywhere, so you can
apply the things that you've learned in

116
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,899
this course at many, many places.

117
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,870
Experience the magic of process mining,
discovering and

118
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,640
improving processes based on
facts rather than fiction.

119
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,450
Thank you for watching this lecture and
all the other lectures.

120
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,130
I hope you enjoyed this course.

121
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,460
I also hope that you will continue
to apply the things you've learned.

122
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,110
Opportunities are endless.

123
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:19,462
All the best!
