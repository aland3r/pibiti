2
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:12,520
Today, we focus on the analysis of so
called lasagna processes.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,710
We can apply all the techniques discussed
in this course to such processes.

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,570
In fact, for lasagna processes,
control for discovery only serves as

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,420
a starting point for
more advanced process mining techniques.

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,310
We've used the term spaghetti and
lasagna processes several times before.

7
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,670
So what does it actually mean?

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,240
If we use the term spaghetti processes,
we are referring to

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,790
processes that are unstructured,
that have irregular behavior,

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,020
that are characterized by words
like flexible and variable.

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,830
Lasagna processes on the other hand.

12
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:59,560
Correspond to processes that
are structured, repetitive, regular, and

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,000
that can be controlled.

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,850
Of course, these are two extremes.

15
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,970
In fact,
one can talk about a spectrum of processes

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,830
ranging from very unstructured
to very structured processes.

17
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,900
Today, we focus on lasagna processes.

18
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,190
Processes that are repetitive and
well structured.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,210
How can we define lasagna processes,
here is an attempt at the rule of thumb.

20
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,160
Saying that for
a lasagna process you should be able to

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,340
create a model that has
a fitness of at least 0.8, and

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,660
the stakeholders can confirm
the validity of the model.

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,980
So this excludes a model
like a flower model.

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,280
The mainstream behavior should fit
into a relatively simple model.

25
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,200
This is an example of a lasagna process.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,610
It's taken from a Dutch municipality and
it corresponds to

27
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,200
event data in the context of people
requesting for household helps.

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,260
So the event log here is
using over 500 requests,

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,310
500 cases, generating approximately
five and a half thousand events.

30
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:25,030
From the dotted chart you can
already see that this process has

31
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,200
a rather regular behavior.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,960
There is a continuous
flow of new cases and

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,270
cases typically take relatively
short amount of time.

34
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,290
If you look at the color of the dots you

35
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,320
can also see that there
are relatively few activities.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,860
If we use the inductive miner then
this is the model that is discovered.

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,760
We can convert it to a Petri net or
a BPMN model.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,520
And they all show the same
relatively simple process.

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,670
If you look at the fitness
of this discovered process.

40
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,080
The fitness is almost perfect, in fact 505

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,210
of the 528 cases fit
perfectly into this model.

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,550
So we can do performance analysis.

43
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,880
And the activity highlighted
here in red is the bottleneck.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,700
It's an optional activity
that often takes a long time.

45
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:36,988
If you use Disco rather than ProM,
we find exactly the same results.

46
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:41,070
And so here in blue you can
see frequencies, in red,

47
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,870
yellow you can see the time
spent in the various phases.

48
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,735
And we find the same bottlenecks.

49
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:58,230
All the stages of the L* lifecycle model
can be visited for such Lasagna processes.

50
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,030
And so we can even do operational support
because the behavior is very regular,

51
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,800
and therefore, for example, we can
predict things based on historic data.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,350
Also, all the ten process mining
activities in the refined reference model

53
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,970
can actually be applied in
the context of lasagna processes.

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,290
So lasagna processes are easy to discover,
but

55
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,620
the drawback is that it is less
interesting to discover the real process.

56
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,980
Because typically people know what
a real process because it is so regular.

57
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,780
So the added value is that the whole
process mining tool box can be applied.

58
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,370
So typically replay techniques are very
important to understand bottlenecks,

59
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,410
to understand decisions in the process
to see which customers take longer,

60
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,660
which customers take shorter.

61
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,190
So the advanced types of process
mining based on alignments

62
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,550
with respect to a relatively simple model,
is where the value lies.

63
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,870
If you would like to read more
on these types of processes,

64
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,000
lasagna processes,
take a look at chapter 11.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,795
Thank you for watching this lecture,
see you next time.
