2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:12,780
Welcome to this lecture of the course on
Process Mining: Data Science in Action.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,690
We are coming closer to
the end of this course.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,550
So it's time for some reflections.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,940
Today we compare process models to maps.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,710
We use this metaphor to better
understand the role of process mining.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,390
There is a long tradition in making maps.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,540
And here you can see a nice example.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:40,180
At the same time, we can view
process models as maps of processes.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,710
So it's interesting to see
what we can learn from maps.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,500
This is a map showing
the center of Moscow.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,280
If you look at such a map we can
see that abstraction is being used.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,620
Insignificant roads are left
out to not clutter the diagram.

14
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,680
At the time, smaller entities
are aggregated into larger ones.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,780
For example, if we would draw 'em out,
we would see individual cities.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,620
If we look at one city in itself,
we can see suburbs.

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,790
Also, maps play with size and color.

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,880
These are not the size and

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,530
the color of the real entities, but they
highlight the things that are important.

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,400
For example, highways will
have a different color than other roads,

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,760
to signify their importance.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,980
Moreover, the layout of things has a clear
meaning that everybody can understand.

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,690
So this is what we can learn from maps.

24
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,350
If we now compare maps to process models.

25
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,660
And, here you can see three examples.

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,800
Then, we can see that process
models are actually very poor.

27
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,050
So, where is abstraction?

28
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,300
Where is aggregation?

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,860
How are size and color being used?

30
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,940
What does the layout of
the different activities in

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,460
a process model actually mean?

32
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,580
There are no strong conventions for this.

33
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,945
Take for
example a look at this process model.

34
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:16,960
The activities,
which activities correspond to

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,430
metropolis which activities
correspond to small village?

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,930
Which connections correspond to highways?

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,140
Which connections
correspond to dirt roads?

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,510
We cannot see these types of things.

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,280
So if we do process mining, we would
like to learn from cartography and

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
add that to the diagrams.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,430
It's also very important
to realize that there is

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,150
no such thing as the map
of a process model.

43
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,243
One would give in one reality,
there may be different process models

44
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:57,040
depending on the purpose for
which one is the making the map.

45
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,760
Take for example again a look at
this map of the center of Moscow.

46
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,170
We may want to zoom in into
a particular area around the Kremlin.

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,690
It's the same reality, but if we zoom in,

48
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,360
we see that a different map is
useful to look at this reality.

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,490
We may want to look at this
diagram if we are interested, for

50
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,610
example, to see where there
are trees in the center of Moscow.

51
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,670
If we travel by a subway,
we need another map.

52
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,980
This is the subway map of Moscow.

53
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,520
Completely different map

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,550
than the maps that we have seen before but
still looking at the same reality.

55
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,580
If we take a bicycle we
would prefer using this map.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,255
So there are different maps depending
on the purpose one is after.

57
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:51,986
This shows that
a map is a view on reality.

58
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:54,810
It's an abstraction that has to be useful.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,660
The map itself is not the same as reality.

60
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,260
Therefore one should not seek in
finding the map, or the process model.

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,740
All these things that we can learn from
maps also apply to process models.

62
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,160
Here you see my glasses
on top of an event log.

63
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,700
A model can be seen as a pair of glasses.

64
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,650
By using these glasses, one can see
relevant information in the raw data,

65
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:33,250
and there is not just one view there may
be multiple views, as is illustrated here.

66
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,590
So depending on the purpose one
needs to look at the event data

67
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,549
from a particular angle, and different
models are useful for this purpose.

68
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,390
It's also important to see process
models not as static entities.

69
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,780
One should breathe life into process
models using the event data available.

70
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,260
If one does not do this,
these process models will be,

71
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,160
will end up in some drawer, and
nobody will ever look at it.

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,660
So we need to connect process models
to data as we have seen in this course.

73
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,320
Again, we see the map of
the center of Moscow, and

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,030
now highlighted in red are the places
where there are traffic jams.

75
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,110
And so the streets that are green,
that the traffic is flowing well,

76
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:32,140
the streets that are red are highlighted
bottlenecks, indicating congestion.

77
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,160
So on maps one can project traffic jams.

78
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,300
One can also project real estate,
which are the houses that are for

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,990
sale in the center of Moscow.

80
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,070
We can highlight the location of vehicles,
like trucks or trains.

81
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,050
One can project crime rates.

82
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,160
One can project all kinds
of things on top of maps.

83
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,530
The same one can do by combining
process models with event data.

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,390
In a process model one can also
highlight the bottlenecks.

85
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,595
One can also highlight where
the model is deviating from reality.

86
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:13,880
Where the biggest cost appear,
where there are risks.

87
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,890
All of these things can be
projected on process models,

88
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,870
thereby breathing life in
these otherwise static models.

89
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,740
Here you can see some
examples,using the tools that we

90
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,220
have been seeing in this course.

91
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,660
So here you see a replay
of an event log on top of

92
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,350
a process model that was discovered.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,770
And at any point in time the animation
is showing a particular state.

94
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,430
And for example one can see traffic
jams in a process model in this way.

95
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,140
The same holds for Disco, and many of
the other process mining tools that we

96
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,790
have been discussing in one
of the recent lectures.

97
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,860
Projecting information
on maps is not that new.

98
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,750
Here you can see a very nice example
of a map showing Napoleon's army.

99
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,977
What you can see is that the Army
starts with over 400,000 soldiers,

100
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:20,560
and then while approaching Moscow,
more and more soldiers die.

101
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,290
In the middle there are 175,000 people,
soldiers still alive.

102
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:33,240
In the end 100,000 soldiers reached
Moscow, but then they need to retreat.

103
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,110
And in the end only
10,000 soldiers return.

104
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,450
So this is an early example
of information visualization.

105
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,620
And it's exactly the same ideas
that we are applying when we

106
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,430
are applying when we are projecting
event data on top of process models.

107
00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,260
It is not sufficient to breathe life
into these models by projecting

108
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,620
event data in a smart way.

109
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,840
We should also try to actively use
the process my, models, for example, for

110
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,890
operational support.

111
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,210
So we should use these
models on a daily basis.

112
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,700
This is very similar to
using a navigation device.

113
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,230
If one looks at a navigation
device for example from TomTom.

114
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,370
Then these devices are showing
you recommendations.

115
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,380
Take the next street and turn left.

116
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,160
We can look at predictions.

117
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,560
What is the estimated arrival time?

118
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,990
It's also warning us if we are driving
too fast at the particular location.

119
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,180
So if you look at these things, you can
clearly recognize the operational support

120
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,160
features that we
have been discussing before.

121
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,550
So how can a navigation device do that?

122
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,960
It's the smart combination of maps,
historic information,

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,920
where are typically traffic jams and
things like that, and current information.

124
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,010
The combination of these things
allows the navigation device

125
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,160
to predict and recommend.

126
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,060
And when we do process mining we would
like to do exactly the same thing.

127
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,610
Note that the navigation
device is also very flexible.

128
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,510
If a driver ignores the instructions,

129
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,260
the navigation device will still
try to support the driver.

130
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,880
And so if the driver goes right rather
than left on the next intersection,

131
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,320
the navigation will try to pick up on
what the driver is trying to do and

132
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,380
support the driver in the actions
that he or she wants to do.

133
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,870
Many information systems are unable
to do these types of things.

134
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,510
They're not combining these different
types of information and

135
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,290
they are typically very inflexible,
or not providing any support at all.

136
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,189
So we can learn from
these types of things.

137
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,630
So in conclusion,
process models are like maps.

138
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,620
We can learn from cartography
to improve our process models.

139
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,810
Smartly using color and
size to indicate the parts

140
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,400
of the process model which are important
or where there is congestion.

141
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,280
We need to highlight this type of
information on top of process models,

142
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,450
otherwise nobody will care.

143
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,140
Often multiple maps are needed, depending
on the goal that we have in mind.

144
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,880
The same if you go by bicycle or you
go by subway, or you go by train.

145
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,240
You need to have a different map.

146
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,480
The same holds for process models.

147
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,610
We need to connect maps to real
data to show traffic jams and

148
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,950
all kinds of other information.

149
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,160
And last but not least,

150
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,670
information systems that we developed
should be more like navigation devices.

151
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,470
Flexible and adaptive.

152
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,740
If you would like to learn
more about this map metaphor.

153
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,000
What we can learn from maps and
navigation devices.

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,180
Please take a look at chapter
13 of the Process Mining book.

155
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,100
Thank you for watching this lecture.

156
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,868
See you soon for
the last lecture of this course.
