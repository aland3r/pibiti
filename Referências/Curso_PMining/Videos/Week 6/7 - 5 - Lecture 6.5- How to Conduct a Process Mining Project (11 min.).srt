2
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,080
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,080
Today we will introduce the L *
lifestyle model for process mining.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,090
It identifies the main stages
of a process mining project, and

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,000
aims to guide the analyst conducting
a process improvement project.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,360
Organizations are drowning in data.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,850
So the challenge is, how to conduct
a process mining project so that you

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,980
can deal with these large amounts of data
and get valuable information out of them.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,310
One way to view a process
mining project is to

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,350
view it as a collection of use cases.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,070
So use cases have a set of goals and

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,420
corresponding actions, so
let's take a look at the goals.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,520
Typically, you are doing process
mining because you would like to

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,079
improve some key performance indicator,
or a set of key performance indicators.

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,240
Things related to time, cost, risk,
quality, all kinds of aspects.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,510
Let's focus at time.

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,100
For example, one may want to minimize
the mean flow time, the waiting time,

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,090
or the response time.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,770
It may also be the case that one is not so
interested in the mean time, but

20
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,900
one would like to maximize
the service level.

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,510
That is, the percentage handled
within an agreed upon period.

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,430
If you look at the action side then we
are not doing process mining just for

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,850
the analysis itself, we would like
to have actionable information.

24
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,140
Information that we can
do something with and

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,240
that we can actually use
to improve the process.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,970
There can be actions related to
a redesign, a structural change of

27
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,600
the process based on the insights
generated by process mining.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,710
It can also be that process mining
triggers adjustments of the process.

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,180
These are non-structural changes,
like changing a parameter.

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,740
A typical example is if there
is a fluctuation in case volume.

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,010
That you may want to add,
temporarily, a few resources.

32
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,210
These are at the process level.

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,200
one may also want
to intervene at the level of individual

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,070
cases or individual resources based on
the insights generated by process mining.

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,230
The most sophisticated form of
process mining is operational support.

36
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,720
Then you are systematically using
current event data, for example,

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,050
to recommend the best activity or the best
resource at a particular point in time.

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,790
Here you can see a list of
typical process mining use cases.

39
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,250
For example, there may be the goal
to reduce the flow time by 30%,

40
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,230
and one would like to know
what are the changes in

41
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,210
the process that should be
made to achieve this goal.

42
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,470
Lets now take a look at the L *
lifecycle model for process mining.

43
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,360
It is a model that describes different
stages of a process mining project.

44
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,720
In a way it is describing
an ideal process mining project.

45
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,440
This is aiming at lasagna processes,
so highly structured processes,

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,330
not the chaotic spaghetti-like processes
that we will also discuss later.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,340
It is related to existing lifecycle models
in the context of data mining and BI.

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,190
Here we can see two
existing lifecycle models.

49
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,430
For example CRISP-DM and SEMMA.

50
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,980
They describe lifecycle models for
a data mining project.

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,150
They are not process mining specific.

52
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,098
And they are of a rather high level.

53
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:15,290
The L * lifecycle model
is much more detailed and

54
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,330
tailored towards the needs
of process mining.

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,420
So what are the stages of
the L * lifecycle model?

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,630
In stage 0, we plan and justify.

57
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,140
In many cases it's crucial
to have a business case

58
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,989
to see possible improvements
that justify doing the analysis.

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,109
One should bear in mind that in general,
there are three types of projects,

60
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:50,070
data-driven projects, projects that
are driven by the availability of data,

61
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,090
organizations that say, we are flooded by
data, we do not know what to do with it,

62
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,360
but we are sure that there is some value
in the information that we have and

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,280
we are not tapping into it yet.

64
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,840
A second type of process mining
project is question-driven.

65
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,170
People would like to understand
why there are certain problems in

66
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,940
particular areas of the process.

67
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,300
The third type is goal-driven.

68
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,630
There the goal is simply to
improve a particular KPI.

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,140
So these contextual factors
are very important,

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,390
to see and understand before you
start doing process mining analysis.

71
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,940
Then in stage 1, after you planned and
justified your activities,

72
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,990
one needs to locate, extract, and
transform the event data available.

73
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,550
This is a non-trivial task.

74
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,810
In previous lectures, we have
discussed how to extract the data and

75
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,970
what the factors are that you should note.

76
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,010
But it's not just event data
that you should collect,

77
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,520
you should also collect existing models.

78
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,032
For example, if you would like to do
conformance checking with respect to

79
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:10,660
some nominative model,

80
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,480
you should collect a model before
doing the actual process mining.

81
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,700
There may be all kinds of other
artifacts that are useful input for

82
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,710
the analysis process.

83
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,320
One should think about objectives and the
questions that one would like to answer.

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,670
In general one should exploit
as much domain knowledge and

85
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,200
knowledge which is in the heads
of people as possible.

86
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,130
After extracting the data and
all the other artifacts, in stage 2,

87
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,130
you create a control-flow model and
connect it to the event log.

88
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,360
As we have seen before, control-flow
is the backbone of every process.

89
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,240
So, we should first create
a suitable control-flow model and

90
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,020
connect it to event data.

91
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,110
The notion of alignments
discussed in the context of

92
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,580
conformance checking is key here.

93
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,130
We would like to relate observed
behavior to modeled behavior.

94
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:17,870
This is a highly iterative process,
so all the stages are iterative,

95
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,820
but in particular, this stage typically
requires several iterations until we

96
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,970
have a control-flow model well-connected
to the available event data.

97
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,890
After having the control-flow model,

98
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,880
we can start looking at
the other perspectives.

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,090
So we can replay event data,
on the model, and then

100
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,850
extend the model with other perspectives,
as we have seen in earlier lectures.

101
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,530
The result is an overall model capturing
all the different perspectives.

102
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,080
Finally, we have stage 4,
operational support.

103
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,020
This is the situation where we are not
just looking at historic information but

104
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,750
where we are using process mining
in real-time in an online setting.

105
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,250
So we would like to detect
deviations as they occur.

106
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,680
We would like to make predictions, for
example, about the remaining flow time.

107
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,170
We would like to make recommendations,

108
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,220
like it's best to have this
activity executed by this person.

109
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,120
Note that the stage 4 is only
reachable for lasagna processes.

110
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,270
So processes that are repetitive and
have a stable structure.

111
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,430
What is now the relationship between
the L * model and the use cases?

112
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,320
Well, that the relationship is very easy.

113
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,230
First of all,

114
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,445
the goal in the use case correspond to
the things that we are doing in stage 1.

115
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,160
Second, process mining should
lead to actionable information and

116
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,629
this is relating to
the other side of use cases.

117
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:13,530
We can also relate the L* lifecycle model
to the refined process mining framework,

118
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,400
as is shown here.

119
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,380
For example, if you look at stage 2,
and stage 2 is

120
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,270
mainly concerned with things like
discovery, conformance checking.

121
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,252
Comparing models,
promoting changes in the defacto model to

122
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:34,390
the de jure model and
a general exploration of event data.

123
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,630
If you look at stage 3,

124
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,450
it is mainly related to the process
mining activity enhance.

125
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,180
By replaying the event log on the model,

126
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,230
we can extend the model using information
extracted from the event log.

127
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:58,230
Last but not least, if we look at stage 4,
we are talking about operational support.

128
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,230
And that corresponds to the process mining
activities predict, recommend, and detect.

129
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,340
In this lecture, we described the L*
lifecycle model for process mining.

130
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,740
As we have seen, the lifecycle model
consists of different stages that

131
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,320
one should go through to do
a successful process mining project.

132
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,990
The approach is highly iterative,
so it may be

133
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,150
that insights in a later stage lead
to changes in an earlier stage.

134
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,870
It is very important to
plan the project well.

135
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,300
First of all, you need to make
sure to get the event data needed.

136
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,730
Second, one should always
think about the business case.

137
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,800
What is one actually improve?

138
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,355
Because analysis is not a goal in itself.

139
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:57,564
If you would like to read more
on the L * lifecycle model,

140
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,995
please take a look at
chapter 11 of the book.

141
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,565
Thank you for watching and
hope to see you soon.
