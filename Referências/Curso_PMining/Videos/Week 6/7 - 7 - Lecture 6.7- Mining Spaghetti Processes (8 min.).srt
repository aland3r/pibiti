2
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:11,580
Today we focus on the analysis of
so-called spaghetti processes.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,450
We cannot apply all
the techniques discussed in

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,510
this course to such processes.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,330
However spaghetti processes often allow
for major improvements in terms of speed,

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,890
cost and compliance, thus making
process mining extremely valuable.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,960
The last lecture we explained
that there is a spectrum.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,980
Ranging from spaghetti
processes to lasagna processes.

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,910
Spaghetti processes
are highly unstructured,

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,420
irregular, flexible, variable.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,740
Whereas lasagna processes
are the opposite.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,030
They are structured, regular,
and very repetitive.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:58,490
So, in this spectrum, today, we will
look on the side of spaghetti processes.

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,790
Why are they called spaghetti processes?

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,340
I think this picture says it all.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,640
And so, many connections and it is very
unclear what the actual structure is.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,940
Here you can see another
example of a spaghetti process.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,730
It is taken from a Dutch hospital,
an event log with information about

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,120
almost 3,000 patients generating
more than 100,000 events.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,700
There are 619 different activities.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,620
So it's clear that if you try
to plot them all in one diagram,

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,550
you will get something
that is very confusing.

23
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,140
There were also 266 different
resources involved.

24
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,880
So it's clear that these processes
are more complicated than the lasagna

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,230
process that we saw in
the previous lecture.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,970
Here is another example.

27
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,980
This is the testing of wafer scanners.

28
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,920
This is the test process.

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,640
And if we zoom in to
parts of this process.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
You can see that it is
indeed very spaghetti like.

31
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:12,470
If we look at spaghetti processes,
we unfortunately cannot execute the later

32
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,250
stages of the L* lifecycle model because
there is not a stable control flow model.

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,360
Where each of the states of
the model is visited frequently.

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,870
So we can forget about operational
support and prediction, recommendation and

35
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,310
these type of things.

36
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:38,400
There is simply not enough data to justify
a reliable prediction or recommendation.

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,660
So the earlier stages may
also be more challenging, but

38
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,380
on the other hand the improvement
potential in such processes maybe much

39
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,310
higher than in lasagna processes
because of their complexity,

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,340
their uncertainty and
the variability of things.

41
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,660
There is often room for improvement.

42
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,010
One should not be afraid of spaghetti.

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,980
First of all,
one can improve the process as explained.

44
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,270
On the other hand,
if you look at the spaghetti diagrams,

45
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,094
you can always make them simpler if they
are too intimidating for the end-user.

46
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,610
For example,
you can focus on a subset of activities.

47
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:29,290
Just look at the most frequent activities
or look at a selected part of the process.

48
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,890
For example, just the backoffice.

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,090
One can also focus on a subset of cases.

50
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,219
So for example, if a process in
a hospital is very confusing, you can

51
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:46,980
focus on a particular group of patients
that has some homogeneous behavior.

52
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,110
There are often natural subclasses,
like for example, gold customers.

53
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,030
The students that have passed.

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,700
One can think of all kinds
of homogeneous sets of

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,080
cases that are easier to analyze
than all the cases together.

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,450
Last but not least one can
focus on a subset of paths.

57
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,280
Here we typically focus on
the most frequent paths.

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,820
What are the highways in the process?

59
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,460
And in this way we can make
spaghetti models much simpler.

60
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,870
Let's take an example in disco.

61
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,820
So this is if we look at all the paths and
all the activities.

62
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,180
The model is very confusing.

63
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,890
However we can focus on
the most frequent activities.

64
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,490
And then this is the model that we get.

65
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,560
We can also focus on all activities.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,919
But at the same time just look
at the most frequent paths.

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,100
Or we can do both.

68
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,430
We can focus just on the most
frequent activities and

69
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,380
the most frequent paths, and
then we get a simple model.

70
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,320
So we can always make spaghetti
models simpler by looking at

71
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,880
the most frequent behavior.

72
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,020
So we have been discussing about lasagna
processes and spaghetti processes.

73
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,740
So where do they appear?

74
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,280
Here you see the functional areas
within a typical organization.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,020
For example one can look at procurement,
getting the products.

76
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,850
For example needed for production.

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,150
One can look at product development,
financial things, resource management,

78
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,920
like HRM.

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,300
One can look at sales and CRM,

80
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,990
so the things that happen before
you sell something to the customer.

81
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,230
And you can look at service.

82
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,280
And, so, activities that happen
after the products has been sold and

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
delivered to the customer.

84
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,600
So if we look at these functional areas,

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,640
then there are natural areas
where we find lasagna processes.

86
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,740
The things highlighted in blue
are typical areas where we can find

87
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,410
a substantial number of lasagna processes.

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,420
We can also look at where can
we find spaghetti processes and

89
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,520
then we find the areas
highlighted here in purple.

90
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,510
So there are areas like, for

91
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,029
example, service where we can find
both spaghetti and lasagna processes.

92
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,850
So to conclude we have been
talking about lasagna processes.

93
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,990
Structure processes of
a repetitive nature.

94
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,170
There we can easily detect and
remove bottlenecks.

95
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:46,140
We can analyze root causes for deviations,
we can compare different processes,

96
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,720
for example, processes in two
different departments, or for

97
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,030
two different types of customer groups.

98
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,100
And we can even do operational support
like prediction, recommendation, and

99
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,570
checking things online.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,600
For spaghetti processes,
many of these things are impossible.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,120
However, process discovery is
incredibly valuable for spaghetti

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,200
processes because they show a mirror,
they show what is actually happening and

103
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,690
they are revealing that things are not as
simple as they may seem at first glance.

104
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,640
It can be used to highlight important
problems in spaghetti processes and

105
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,280
there is often room for
a lot of improvement.

106
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,118
And we can go from
management by PowerPoint to

107
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:36,710
evidence-based process improvement.

108
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,910
So this is very valuable.

109
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,540
If you would like to read more
about the spaghetti processes.

110
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,050
Please take a look at chapter 12.

111
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,165
Thank you for watching this lecture.

112
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:49,669
See you next time.
