2
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:12,070
Welcome to this lecture of the course on
Process Mining: Data Science in Action.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,100
This is the first lecture of the sixth and
last week.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,440
Today we will learn about
operational support techniques.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,900
For example, we'll show that we are able
to predict the remaining flow time of

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,050
a case.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,350
The other lectures in this week will
focus more on the practical aspects of

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,110
process mining.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,060
In the first week of this
course we talked about

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,520
the four generic data science questions.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,720
And today we are going to revisit them.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,500
The first generic data science
question is what happened?

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,540
Through process discovery and
many of the other techniques that we

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,030
looked at we can clearly
answer such a question.

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,690
We are analyzing the past and can show
what are the things that happened?

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,640
What are the order in which
people have executed activities?

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,190
Where were the bottlenecks and
things like that?

18
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,180
The second generic data science
question is why did it happen?

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,760
And if we are analyzing bottlenecks,

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,930
this is exactly the type of question
that we are trying to answer.

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,310
So true decision mining and all the mining
techniques focused more on performance,

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,780
we often try to understand what
the reason is why things have happened.

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,360
The first two questions are very
much focused on the past.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,630
Understanding the past and
learning things for the future.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,390
Operational support, however,
is focusing on questions three and

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,230
four of the generic
data science questions.

27
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,430
So the question,
what will happen is about prediction.

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,290
Can we predict what is going
to happen in the future?

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,920
For example, for a running case, when
do we think the case will be finished?

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,250
Or, will the case be rejected?

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,450
This is the type of question
that we will look at in

32
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,250
the context of operational support.

33
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,060
If we can make predictions we can
also answer the fourth question.

34
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,370
And that is what is
the best that can happen?

35
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,700
Based on experiences from
the past we can recommend certain

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,300
actions to be taken to optimize
a process in terms of cost,

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,580
time, risks, compliance,
and other types of things.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,610
So, the last two data science
questions are the questions that we

39
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,800
focus on today in the context
of operational support.

40
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,660
Operational support starts
from pre mortem data,

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,140
data about cases that are still running.

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,090
So what are, then,

43
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,260
the three process mining activities
that we execute in this context?

44
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,630
The first one is detect.

45
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,060
Detection is about finding out
that something is happening at

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,700
this point in time.

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,930
So for example, a case is deviating.

48
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,720
A deadline has just expired.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,570
And we don't want to do this afterwards.

50
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,190
We want to do it at
the moment that it happens.

51
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,500
Then we have prediction.

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,180
When will a case finish?

53
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,780
Will the case be rejected?

54
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,290
Will a case deviate?

55
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,580
We would like to predict
these types of things.

56
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,760
And last but not least, we would like
to recommend what a suitable next

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,920
activity is, or what a best resource is
that can execute a particular activity.

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,220
So these are the questions
that we will look at.

59
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,300
Now let's look at these three process
mining activities in a bit more detail.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,330
So assume the scenario where
we are executing a case and

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,310
we have already executed activities a and
b and

62
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,550
we are now in a state where we do not
know what will happen in the future.

63
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,290
Many things can happen.

64
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,080
So, at this point in time what
does operational support mean?

65
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,010
If we talk about detection, we may, for

66
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,140
example, generate an alert,
because b just happened and

67
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,310
it was not supposed to happen according
to some normative process model.

68
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,240
That's an example of an alert.

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,390
Another alert could be that something is
executed, and it should be executed, but

70
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,520
it was executed too late.

71
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,500
So, things like too late, but

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,230
also things like done by the wrong
resource are the types of

73
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,500
things that we would like to detect and
generate alerts while the case is running.

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
Then we have prediction.

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,630
Suppose that a and

76
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,940
b have happened, and we would like to
predict when the process will be finished.

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,420
We can learn from experiences in
the past and give a good estimate for

78
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,670
the remaining processing time of a case.

79
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,750
But we may also want to predict
the outcome of a process.

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,760
If we can do predictions, we can
automatically also do recommendations.

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,130
Based on past experiences, we may for

82
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,880
example recommend executing
activity c at this point in time.

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,390
Or we may recommend that an activity
is done by

84
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,320
a particular resource.

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,650
That has shown to be able to
execute that activity well.

86
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,310
So these are the types of activities
that we will focus on today.

87
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,270
So we will use a running example that
we have seen several times before.

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,550
So here you can see
a fragment of the event log,

89
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,980
you can see the corresponding
process model.

90
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,850
We leave out all the other attributes.

91
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,310
We just focus on activities and time.

92
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,680
But it's important to realize that
operational support also relates to all of

93
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,940
the other perspectives that we have been
discussing in the last couple of lectures.

94
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,810
If we have such a process model
we can automatically convert it

95
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,140
to a transition system
as we have seen before.

96
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,150
What you should note is that for

97
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,240
every activity we have a start
event and a complete event.

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,420
So we also identify the states
of an activity running.

99
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,270
And if you look at the states of
the transition system, you can see that,

100
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,490
that is indeed the case.

101
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,910
So we will use this example, but

102
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,950
first let's show an overview
of how detection works.

103
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,830
So there is a person working on the case
at the particular point in time.

104
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,959
At the same time,
before a normative model has been made.

105
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,720
Then the information system and

106
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,970
the operational support
system are interacting.

107
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,800
The moment a person is executing
work a partial trace is sent to

108
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,050
the operational support system.

109
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,850
And if this trace deviates from the
normative model a violation is detected.

110
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,240
And the user or the manager is informed
that such a detection,

111
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,400
that such a deviation has taken place.

112
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,010
So violations can be detected, and
this can be the wrong activity,

113
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,169
an activity executed too late,
and things like this.

114
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,410
So let's take a look at an example.

115
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,640
So here we have a process model.

116
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,450
Suppose that we have already
started working on a.

117
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,930
A was completed at time 19.

118
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,626
Then at time 25 we started b.

119
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:41,762
At time 27 we started d.

120
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,689
At this point in time there is no
reason to generate any type of alert,

121
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:49,160
because this is perfectly
conforming to the process model.

122
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,770
Now suppose that at time 28,
somebody starts working on

123
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,880
activity e, but b and
d have not yet completed.

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,830
So at that point in time,
when somebody starts working on e,

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,020
we would like to generate an alert and

126
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,800
detect the violation with respect
to the normative process model.

127
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,740
So this is what detection is all about.

128
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,800
The second type of operational
support is prediction.

129
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,260
Again people are working on cases,

130
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,150
they are interacting with
an information system.

131
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,540
And it may be that at some point in
time they would like to know what is

132
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,980
the remaining processing time,
or what is a likely outcome for

133
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,850
this particular process instance.

134
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,470
Then a predictive model can be used.

135
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,050
Such a predictive model is learned
over historic information.

136
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,070
So learned over an event log
as is shown on this slide.

137
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,250
This is input for
the operational support system that

138
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,500
combines the partial trace together
with the predictive model and

139
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,680
makes a prediction about what is
going to happen in the future.

140
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,100
And this prediction is passed
on to the user who will

141
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,860
know what estimated completion
time of a case will be.

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,150
So let's take a look at some
examples of predictions.

143
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,890
So the example that we just saw
is about the remaining flow time.

144
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,240
But we can predict many other things.

145
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,940
Will we be able to meet a deadline or not?

146
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,120
We can attach a probability to it.

147
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,280
We can look at will
a particular person or

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,470
a particular group of persons
work on a particular case.

149
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,230
Will it be routed to
a particular department?

150
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,120
We can attach a probability to that.

151
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,780
We can look at whether a certain
activity is likely to be executed or

152
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,630
not in the future.

153
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,520
We can look at costs, and we can also
look at the outcome of the process.

154
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,770
Is this a case that is likely
to be rejected or not?

155
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,870
These can all be, these predictions can

156
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,780
all be made by combining a predictive
model and a partial trace.

157
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,300
So let us take a look at an annotated
transition system where we

158
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,140
take the original transition system and
annotate it with time information.

159
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:26,510
So here you see the execution of
two traces, and for every case and

160
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,850
for every state that the case visits, we
record the time that the state is entered.

161
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,980
The elapsed time until
the moment that the state is entered,

162
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,690
the remaining time and the sojourn time.

163
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,340
So how much time is spent
in that particular state.

164
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,260
So here you can see the annotated
transition system in more detail.

165
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:55,150
So we have two cases and if we focus
on the first case, the one in blue,

166
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:03,530
then we can see that at time 12 it entered
the state where activity a started to run.

167
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,020
The elapsed time at that point in time
was 0, and the remaining time was 42.

168
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,520
And the sojourn time
in this state is 7.

169
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,700
We can look at this particular event.

170
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,890
A was completed at time 19.

171
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:31,148
The elapsed time in the state that
we are looking at now is 7.

172
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:35,880
And so 7 time units have passed
since the beginning of the case,

173
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,545
the remaining time is 35 and
the sojourn time is 6.

174
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,750
We can look at the end
of this particular case.

175
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:54,760
At time 54 it enters the last state, then
the elapsed time has been 42 time units.

176
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,755
The remaining time is of course 0.

177
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,520
So this is the way that we can annotate
transition system using the replay

178
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,199
techniques that we have seen before.

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,560
We can do this for many cases and
then collect the results per state.

180
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,040
So every state in the transition
system has a bunch of elapsed times,

181
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,850
remaining times, and sojourn times.

182
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,890
And we can compute the average,
the variance, and

183
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,740
all kinds of other properties
over these states.

184
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,720
Now, suppose that we
are executing a case and

185
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,570
that case is in the state where
there is a token in p3 and p4.

186
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,890
Then based on historic information we can,
for

187
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:48,010
example, predict that the average
remaining time is 42 time units.

188
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,460
So this is the way that
we can make predictions,

189
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,500
based on things that we have
learned over past executions.

190
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,470
What is very important is
to understand that for

191
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,650
predictions, we should not
just focus on the case itself.

192
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,110
In the previous example,
we just looked at the case in isolation.

193
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,670
But you have to realize that
in real life processes,

194
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,640
it is very important to use context
when you are predicting things.

195
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,410
If you are standing in a long
queue of people then you

196
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,140
cannot ignore all the other
cases that are around you.

197
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,310
Your waiting time will depend on
how many other cases there are.

198
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,400
There's a very simple example
showing that you need to

199
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,980
incorporate context information, and

200
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,749
this is a topic that we have discussed
in one of the earlier lectures.

201
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,890
The last type of operational
support is recommending.

202
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,600
And what kind of things
would we like to recommend?

203
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,890
We would like to recommend what
is the best next activity,

204
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,490
what is a suitable resource,
things like this.

205
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,110
So how does this work?

206
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,410
Again, there is a user interacting with an
information system, and on the other side

207
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,000
we have a model that we have
learned over event logs.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,210
So we have a recommendation model,
it's similar to a predictive model,

209
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,470
that is used by the operational support
system to recommend the best action

210
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,760
that can be taken by comparing a partial
trace to the recommendation model.

211
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,090
And then, for example,
it can say it is best that

212
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,190
you now execute this activity and
it should be done by this person.

213
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,780
A recommendation is always given
with respect to a specific goal.

214
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,600
So, we may want to minimize costs.

215
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,340
We may want to minimize
the remaining flow time.

216
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,580
We may want to maximize the service level,
and so

217
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,020
the fraction of cases handled
within a particular time.

218
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:05,320
We may want to maximize a certain outcome
of the process or minimize resource usage.

219
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,100
So, predictive model should look at
history, having a particular goal in mind.

220
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,690
What is interesting to see
is that the moment you have

221
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,910
a predictive model you can
automatically turn that

222
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,440
predictive model in a model that
you can use to recommend things.

223
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,160
This is illustrated on this slide.

224
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,440
So if we are in a particular state we
can make a prediction about the future.

225
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,470
In this state,
based on the process model we know what

226
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,030
the actions are that may take
place in this particular state.

227
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,970
What we can then do is that we can
just add them to the event log and

228
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,880
then make a prediction.

229
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,680
We do not really execute these activities,
but we add them to event log,

230
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,920
then make a prediction, in the way
that we did before, and we do that for

231
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,360
all possible actions, and then we
compare the different possible futures.

232
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,020
And then, based on this information,
we can recommend one or

233
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,960
multiple actions to take place.

234
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,530
So if we are able to predict,
we are also able to recommend.

235
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,130
And this a very powerful
feature we can exploit.

236
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,730
So in this lecture we looked
at operational support.

237
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,110
It's the transition from offline process
mining to online process mining.

238
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,079
And this way we enable predictive
analytics for processes.

239
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,640
If you would like to read more
about operational support,

240
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,960
chapter nine is focusing on this topic.
