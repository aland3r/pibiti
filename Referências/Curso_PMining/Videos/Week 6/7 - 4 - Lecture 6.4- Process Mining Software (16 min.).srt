2
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:12,100
Welcome to this lecture of the course on
Process Mining: Data Science in Action.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,230
Today we will provide an overview of
available process mining software.

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,820
We will also relate process
mining tools like ProM and

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,850
Disco, to other data sign tools.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,800
Data scientists need to have data,
tools, and preferably also questions.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,870
In the previous lectures
we focused very much on

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,080
the event data needed
to do process mining.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,980
Today we will focus on the tools.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,440
And of course, we have been playing with
tools like ProM and Disco, so we already

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,320
have a good understanding of process
mining functionality by tools like these.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,030
However, today we would like
to expand this spectrum and

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,430
also look at other tools.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,550
Here in this diagram you see Disco and
ProM.

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,880
So both Disco and
ProM are process mining specific tools.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,230
They have been developed for
the purpose of doing process mining.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,640
Disco is simple, easy to use,
very fast, very convenient.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,975
ProM is more powerful,
provides much more types of analysis, but

19
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:24,040
it also, much more difficult to use.

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,860
Both are not part of any bigger suite,
like a complete BPM tool or

21
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,620
something like that.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,090
Next to process mining software you have
the classic called data mining software.

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,390
Like RapidMiner, R and Knime.

24
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,840
These do not provide process
mining capabilities.

25
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,290
There are also other
commercial tools other than

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,283
Disco like Perceptive Process Mining and
Celonis Discovery.

27
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:58,285
And that is an interesting
combination of RapidMiner and

28
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,360
ProM, which is called RapidProM.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,890
We'll look at these systems
later in a bit more detail.

30
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,980
So this is the spectrum of
tools that one can use.

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,090
If one would like to select
a process mining tool

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,850
then the refined reference
model can help you.

33
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,160
The first question you
should ask yourself.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,390
Which of the ten process mining
activities are important for

35
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,890
me, and which are supported.

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,420
So is discovery supported?

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,780
Is conformance checking supported?

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,270
And for example, do we need to be able
to predict the remaining flow time?

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,090
Another question is, what
are the perspectives that are supported?

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Are resources supported?

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,180
Is the data perspective supported?

42
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,080
How are things related to time?

43
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,170
Another question is,
what modeling notations are supported?

44
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,620
Petri nets, BPMN, or what other
notations that you find relevant?

45
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,190
And last but

46
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,750
not least, what are the import and export
formats that are supported for event logs,

47
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,520
models, alignments and
all kinds of other artifacts?

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,440
So, this is a checklist when you want
to select a process mining tool.

49
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,780
For example, if you look at ProM, and
look at the the red area here.

50
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,680
It aims to support the entire
process mining spectrum.

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,295
It supports many different types of
notations ranging from Petri nets and

52
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:28,620
BPMN, to more exotic formats like
the declarative language Declare.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,700
ProM also supports
conformance checking and

54
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,360
operational support,
unlike many of the commercial tools.

55
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,651
There are a hundreds of
plug-ins available, but

56
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:44,220
many of them are experimental and
not always user friendly.

57
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,090
On the other end of the spectrum,
one can find tools like Disco.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,570
The tool that you've also
been using in this course.

59
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,990
Here the focus is not on the entire
spectrum, but on discovery and

60
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,710
performance analysis including animation.

61
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,120
Disco provides very powerful
filtering capabilities and

62
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,680
you can use these to do
comparative process mining.

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,390
You can also do very basic forms
of conformance checking by

64
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,760
checking whether a certain
behavioral pattern appears or not.

65
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,350
It uses a variant of fuzzy models.

66
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,620
So it doesn't have 
an executable model underneath it.

67
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,450
And it does not support things
like conformance checking and

68
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,020
operational support.

69
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,590
But it is very easy to use, and
it has an excellent performance.

70
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,270
Much faster than many of
the mature data mining tools.

71
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,880
So, these are two ends of the spectrum.

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,910
There are several other commercial tools.

73
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,210
Here you can see some of them.

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,260
In my teaching in Eindhoven,
I'm using, for

75
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,610
example, also Perceptive Process Mining,
and Celonis Discovery.

76
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,280
But there are many other tools available.

77
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,960
If one looks at these commercial tools,

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
they are similar to
Disco in terms of scope.

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,850
Often they are not as user friendly,
and often also a bit slower, but

80
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,950
in terms of scope they
are very comparable.

81
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,670
They focus on control flow and
performance analysis.

82
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,760
There is no support for conformance
checking, operational support and

83
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,130
many more of the sophisticated
features that you can find in ProM.

84
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,280
Let's take a look at three
concrete examples of

85
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,490
tools other than this current ProM.

86
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,380
Let's first take a look at RapidProM.

87
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,380
So this is a combination of ProM and
RapidMiner.

88
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,750
And so ProM is in a way embedded in
RapidMiner, and one gets a graphical

89
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:58,020
environment where one has dozens of
process mining related building blocks.

90
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,590
And one can build an analysis flow.

91
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,010
If you would like to learn more about
this, you can visit the URL on this slide.

92
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,660
It's also available through
the RapidMiner marketplace.

93
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,940
So what can you do in RapidProM?

94
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,340
You can build your own
process mining workflow, and

95
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,250
then execute it on any data set.

96
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,210
So we can take as an example
this very simple process mining workflow.

97
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,380
And let's take a look
at the building blocks.

98
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,160
First we need to create the ProM context.

99
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,650
In other words, we need to start up ProM.

100
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,140
And relate all the other building
blocks to this instance of ProM.

101
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,060
If we want to copy something we need
to use this building block for that.

102
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,420
But it's just a technicality.

103
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,120
The real work starts with this building
block, where we read the event log.

104
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,860
The output of this building block is
an event log in the RapidProM environment.

105
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,940
And then this event log can
be taken by a building block

106
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,140
that represents the alpha algorithm.

107
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,880
So it takes an event lock,
and produces a Petri net.

108
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,050
Subsequently, we have a building block for

109
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,910
doing conformance checking
based on alignments.

110
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,930
So now we can
run this workflow on any event log.

111
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,040
And here you see example
output in RapidProM.

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,830
That's why here you see the discovered
process model by the alpha algorithm.

113
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,210
And here you can see
the conformance check done by

114
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,880
the conformance checking building block,
based on alignment.

115
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,585
This is an example of another
process mining workflow.

116
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,630
What are the building blocks?

117
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,730
We first load an event log.

118
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,100
We then in parallel create a dotted chart.

119
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,930
We create a Petri net
using the inductive miner.

120
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,440
And we create a social network based
on the handover of work approach.

121
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,440
And if we run this workflow
on a particular event log,

122
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,070
we get results like a dotted chart,
a Petri net model, and a social network.

123
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,370
And if we would like to apply this
workflow to another event log

124
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,060
it is very simple.

125
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,560
So.

126
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,980
Using RapidProM, we can repeat process
mining analysis very quickly.

127
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,340
This is very useful for

128
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,980
scientific experiments where one would
like to play with the parameter.

129
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,489
But also if one would like to
reuse prepackaged analysis.

130
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,220
It can also be used to combine process
mining with other forms of data mining.

131
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,880
It can also be combined with text mining,
by combining building blocks of

132
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,410
ProM with the building blocks
that are already on rapidminer.

133
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,620
So that was one example.

134
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,590
Another example of another tool
is Celonis Discovery a commercial

135
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,638
process mining tool.

136
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:09,110
It is web-based.

137
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,450
It supports process discovery, but

138
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,370
unfortunately it doesn't
support concurrency.

139
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,559
So, the models that are discovered are,
in essence, transition systems.

140
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,420
It can show frequencies,

141
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,090
how frequently a case is flowing from
one activity to another activity.

142
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,180
It can show time information,
so where are the bottlenecks?

143
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,828
All the things that we have
also seen in Disco before.

144
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,090
It also supports animation.

145
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,510
You can animate a log on top
of a discovered model, and

146
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,420
it supports seamless abstraction.

147
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,750
And so there is again
the slider like functionality.

148
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,090
Here we see all the details
of a particular event log and

149
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,260
by moving the slider we can make
the process model more simple,

150
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,060
until we get something that
is easy to understand.

151
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,550
There are also all kinds of
performance-related dashboards.

152
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,675
So in scope, it is very similar to the
things which we have seen in this Disco.

153
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,440
Another example of a commercial process
mining tool is Perceptive Process Mining.

154
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,440
It can be used in conjunction with
the BPM product of perceptive.

155
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,150
So models that have been discovered can be

156
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,020
automatically uploaded in the business
process management system of perceptive.

157
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,000
It is also web-based.

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,250
It supports process discovery.

159
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,490
And it supports two types of discovery.

160
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,800
One type is fast, but
cannot discover concurrency.

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,370
So again,
the output is a transition system.

162
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,190
There is also a more sophisticated mining
algorithm, based on the genetic process

163
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,940
mining techniques discussed earlier,
that is able to discover concurrency.

164
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,540
Again, we can filter the event log and

165
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,410
the model in various ways, for
example based on frequency.

166
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,030
We can replay the event log.

167
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,810
And a nice feature in the perceptive
software is that you can color the tokens

168
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,500
based on attributes of
the corresponding event or case.

169
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,020
So here tokens are colored
based on their flowtime.

170
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,500
So you can see whether certain very slow

171
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,600
cases take a particular
path through the model.

172
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,950
You can also change the perspective and
look at resources.

173
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:47,910
So here you see the social network of
the three most frequent resources.

174
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,910
And you can see how tokens are flowing
from one resource to the other resource.

175
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,290
Now tokens are colored based on
the activity being executed.

176
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,430
And, again, there are all kinds
of performance related charts and

177
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,899
you can find these in any
of the commercial tools.

178
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,150
So after showing some commercial
process mining products,

179
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,960
it's interesting to
broaden the scope a bit.

180
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,300
For example, we can look at BPM systems.

181
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,900
What can be expected is that
in the future, more and

182
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,480
more BPM systems will
support process mining.

183
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,350
At this point in time,
very few BPM systems actually support

184
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,690
things like process discovery and
conformance checking.

185
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,610
One can also look at existing
data mining techniques.

186
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,200
And software, and
machine learning software.

187
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,580
They are very related but at the same
time, if you look at existing software,

188
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,770
they typically do not support
any form of process mining.

189
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,830
We can also look at predictive analytics,
but

190
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,150
you can see that the software there
is often not process oriented at all.

191
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,800
A question could be how about BI tools?

192
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,010
So what is BI?

193
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,790
What is Business Intelligence?

194
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,100
A possible definition given
by somebody from Forester is,

195
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,000
BI is a set of methodologies,
processes, architectures and

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,910
technologies that transform raw data
into meaningful and useful information.

197
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,750
Used to enable more effective,
strategic, tactical and

198
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,810
operational insights and decision making.

199
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,580
So this is a mouthful and

200
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,900
if you read it, I think everybody will
agree that process mining is part of it.

201
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,550
However, if you look at the existing BI
products that one can find on the market.

202
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,490
None of these products is actually
supporting process mining.

203
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:58,360
so, process mining is still functionality
that needs to be added to these tools.

204
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,260
What do these tools offer?

205
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:08,700
They offer typical functionality like ETL,
extract, transform and load functionality,

206
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,210
querying, reporting, interactive
dashboards like the one that you see here

207
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,600
and generating alerts if thing starts
to occur differently than planned.

208
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,890
So, such functionality is typically not
process oriented, and despite the name,

209
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:36,547
the type of analysis is typically quite
simplistic, more spreadsheet-like.

210
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:42,700
So, in conclusion, there are several
process mining tools available,

211
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,570
but it is still
a relatively young discipline.

212
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,240
So, we expect that in the future
many more process mining tools

213
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,780
will become available, and that they
will become standard, embedded, in BI,

214
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,790
BPM, and data mining suites.

215
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,150
One should avoid a trap,

216
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,890
based on definitions that process
mining is a part of data mining.

217
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,830
By definition it is true.

218
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,610
But data mining software typically does
not provide things like process discovery,

219
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,270
conformance checking, and

220
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,090
the forms of operational support
that we have been looking at.

221
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,980
The same holds for BI.

222
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,011
So one you avoid this trap and use
the checklist that I've explained earlier.

223
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,260
If you would like to read more
on tools please take a look at

224
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,450
chapter 10 of the process mining book.

225
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,677
Thank you for watching this lecture,
see you next time.
