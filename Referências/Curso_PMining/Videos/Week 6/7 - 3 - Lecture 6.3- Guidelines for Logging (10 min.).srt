2
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:11,495
In the last lecture we learned
that it may be very challenging to

3
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:15,030
extract event logs from
today's data sources.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,569
This lecture presents 12 guidelines
to improve the logging of events.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,560
So today, just like the last lecture,

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,680
we focus again on the input
side of process mining.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,330
But now we do not identify
the problems that we may encounter.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,710
But we provide guidelines to
get a better kind of logging.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,300
We have seen that there may be
many data quality problems and

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,610
these are caused by an incorrect
recording of events.

11
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,460
The data is missing,
it may be at a wrong level of detail, or

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,830
it may be simply incorrect.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,540
So the guidelines of logging
focus on these issues.

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,150
To explain the guidelines,
we are using the following terms.

15
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,860
So events are things that happen and

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,720
they are described by references and
attributes.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,380
So an event reference
points to some object.

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,170
A person, a case, a ticket, a room.

19
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,920
It is referring to an entity
that exists in the real world.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,610
An attribute is a name value pair.

21
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,580
So for example, an activity has a name.

22
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,700
An event may refer to
the age of a patient or

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,600
an attribute may refer to
a particular point in time.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,850
So these are the terms that we
use to explain the 12 guidelines.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,300
So lets start.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,470
So the first guideline for
logging looks at

27
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,380
the semantics of events and
the reference and

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,400
attribute names, they should have
the same meaning for all people involved.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,860
It cannot be that a particular
attribute means something different for

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,320
different stakeholders involved in the
recording and analysis of the event data.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,350
The second guideline refers to that
there should be a structured and

32
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,432
managed collection of reference and
attribute names.

33
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:31,490
It cannot be the case that somebody that
is programming an information system

34
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,560
in an ad hoc manner inserts
statements in the code.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,800
To start recording things without
really having a discussion and

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,210
an explicit decision before.

37
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,450
So any new event,
any new reference or attribute name

38
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,860
should only be added if there is
consensus about that it is relevant.

39
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,246
And that it has a particular meaning.

40
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:03,410
The third guideline refers to the fact
that references should be stable.

41
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,290
They should not be context dependent.

42
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,760
It cannot be the case that if we
change the language setting of

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,270
a machine that things will change.

44
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,800
Or that over time things change.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,820
So a stability of
references is important.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,460
Attribute names should also
be as precise as possible.

47
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,530
As an example that we have used before
when we were talking about data

48
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,690
quality problems is that the many event
logs we do not know the exact timestamp.

49
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,080
We only know the date.

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,100
If we have that and we have the difficulty
of ordering events that take place on

51
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,070
the same date because we do not
know their order in a reliable way.

52
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,530
So if data is imprecise,

53
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,010
in some cases it's unavoidable,
it should be indicated explicitly.

54
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,890
A related guideline is guideline five,
that refers to uncertainty.

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,030
If events, reference, or

56
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,700
attributes are uncertain to some degree,
it should be stated explicitly.

57
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,780
So if we are not sure about the time.

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,780
If you are not sure about which
resource executed something and

59
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,210
we make an educated guess.

60
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,180
It should be indicated so
in the event log.

61
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,299
So that we can use this
information during analysis.

62
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,710
The sixth guideline refers to the fact
that events data should be ordered,

63
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,400
and there are two ways of doing that.

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,660
There can be timestamps and
these timestamps are used for ordering.

65
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,150
Or the order is stored explicitly
in terms of a list of,

66
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,910
or if it's a partial order
in terms of a graph.

67
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,010
If we, for example, have timestamps
that just refer to the day,

68
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,530
then we may have difficulties
reconstructing the order.

69
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,440
But there are dedicated analysis
techniques to still try to

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,080
capture the order,
even though we have such problems.

71
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,030
Guideline seven refers to
transactional information.

72
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,360
If possible, we should not just
record the completion of an activity,

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
we should try to get the start and
the completion.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,570
If things are aborted, suspended, or
resumed, all this transaction information,

75
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,110
if we can record it we should,
because it will help us, for

76
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,270
example, to compute what
the duration of the activity is, but

77
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,548
also what the utilization is
of a particular resource.

78
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:48,220
The eighth guideline refers to

79
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,390
the fact that guarding
the quality of event data

80
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,850
is a continuous process there should
be regular checks of the logging.

81
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,110
Should not be done just at
the beginning but while the process and

82
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,030
the system is evolving.

83
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,980
We should repeatedly check whether
the logging is up to date.

84
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,680
The ninth guideline
refers to comparability.

85
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:19,940
The logging itself should
not change over time and

86
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,120
should not depend
on the particular context.

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,110
For example, suppose that in
a process at some point in time we

88
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,500
stop recording a particular activity.

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,680
We may make the conclusion that,

90
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,490
that activity was first executed and
later in time, it is no longer executed.

91
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,600
But at conclusion would be wrong because
it's just a change in recording.

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,990
The same as if you would for

93
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,080
example, you would like to compare
the performance of two departments

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,870
if one department is logging in
a different way than the other department.

95
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,350
You would conclude that there are certain
differences that do not really exist.

96
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,840
So comparability is key.

97
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,370
When we were discussing process mining in

98
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,440
the context of data warehouses and OLAP
we made the point that we should

99
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,850
avoid aggregating event data which is
often done in these types of systems.

100
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,390
Aggregation should
be done during analysis and

101
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,180
not before because it cannot be undone.

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,860
So
event data should be as raw as possible.

103
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,070
Guideline 11.

104
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,460
We should not remove
events that have happened.

105
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,360
For example,
if we would analyze student data and

106
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,620
we would remove all the students that
dropped out of a particular program,

107
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,189
we will get very misleading
analysis results.

108
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,210
For example if you would
look at concerts,

109
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,620
we should not delete a concert
if the concert is cancelled.

110
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,710
We should not delete an employee if
the employee is fired because we

111
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,515
are removing information and
that is endangering provenance.

112
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,120
The last guideline is about privacy.

113
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,090
And here there is a very delicate balance
between on the one hand ensuring privacy.

114
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,270
And on the other hand still being
able to do meaningful analysis.

115
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,730
So often there is no
interest whatsoever to

116
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,470
record that cases refer
to a particular person.

117
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:39,100
However, we would like to correlate events
that are referring to the same person.

118
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,320
So hashing is a way to make
data anonymous while still

119
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,506
being able to make conclusions and
relating different events.

120
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:56,150
If we make information too abstract we

121
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,590
may remove these correlations and it will
be difficult to do any type of analysis.

122
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,290
So these were the 12 guidelines for
logging and they show you that

123
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,440
the points that you should look at
when you are designing a system.

124
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,160
What are the things
that you should record?

125
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,510
And this is very important for
further analysis.

126
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,640
Because garbage in, garbage out.

127
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,730
If we start by recording
events in the wrong way, or

128
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,600
in an inconsistent way,

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,370
it will be very difficult to get
meaningful analysis results from that.

130
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,922
To read more about the guidelines for
logging,

131
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:43,892
you can take a look at the article
shown here at the bottom of the slide.

132
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,691
Thank you for watching this lecture.

133
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,334
See you next time.
