2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,768
Glad to see you again for

3
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:13,560
this third lecture of the course on
Process Mining, Data Science in Action.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,659
Today, we will see how process
mining relates to data mining.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,450
Process mining,
as I explained in the last lecture,

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,170
is the missing link between
model based analysis,

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,690
process model based analysis, and
data oriented analysis like data mining.

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,390
With the goal to answer
performance oriented questions and

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,890
compliance oriented questions.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,965
So one can think of process
mining as super glue.

11
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,390
It's the glue between data and processes.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,195
It's the glue between business people and
IT people.

13
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:52,600
It's the glue between
business intelligence and

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,655
business process management.

15
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,410
It's the glue between performance and
compliance.

16
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,850
And you can do this at runtime,
and at design time.

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,910
So it's connecting many different things,
and that makes it so incredibly valuable.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,780
This diagram gives a kind of
overview showing that process

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,690
mining is this world, this discipline
connecting business process

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:23,020
management to classical data
analytics like data mining.

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,580
And, as we have seen in the last lecture,
process mining consists of different

22
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,000
types of mining, and here you can see
process discovery and conformance checking.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,760
Later we will also look
at predictive analytics.

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,040
How you can use process mining to
predict things about the future.

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,440
If you see this diagram,
you may ask yourself the question,

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,020
how about BI, business intelligence?

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,210
Well if you look at the classical
BI tools, they tend to show

28
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,610
only spreadsheets, meters, graphs,

29
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:07,240
they try to capture reality in a set
of numbers, and that is not sufficient.

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,230
This is illustrated by
Anscombe's Quartet that's the four

31
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,980
diagrams that you see here.

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,890
And let me explain what we are seeing.

33
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,870
We are seeing four different data sets,
each consisting of 11 elements.

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,880
They look very different, but

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,880
if you look at their statistical
properties, they are almost the same.

36
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,299
So if we look at the mean x
coordinate of these 11 elements in

37
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:44,732
each of the four cases the mean is nine,
the variance is 11.

38
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,542
If we look at the y coordinate,

39
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:52,020
we also can see that all of these
four diagrams are exactly the same.

40
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,320
Even when we apply linear regression,

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,220
all of these four data sets,
yield exactly the same result.

42
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,240
So, this is illustrating,
if a BI tool is just showing numbers,

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,450
that is often not sufficient.

44
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,550
You have to look behind the numbers,
because things can be very different.

45
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,690
One can think of process mining
as finding desire lines.

46
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,650
Here you can see a photo that I took at
a campus of Tsinghua University in Beijing,

47
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,800
and here you see one of my colleagues
there walking over a desire line.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,060
So this is a trail in a grassy area
that is showing what people really do.

49
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,310
So, the trail can be seen
as the event data, and

50
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,560
the sign saying that you should not
walk there, that you should use the

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,190
official route can be
seen as the process model.

52
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,060
So this is an illustration of
what process mining tries to do.

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,860
You try to uncover the desire lines,
what do people really do.

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,140
And, you can find very surprising things.

55
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,830
So for
example if you look at this desire line,

56
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,890
it is clearly showing that people
do not follow the process model.

57
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,830
The, the gates that you see here is aimed
of keeping cyclists out of this park.

58
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,370
But what you can see is that
the desire line is showing that people

59
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,020
do not follow the things
that they should do here.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,180
So the gate does not work
as it is supposed to work.

61
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,650
So using process mining and

62
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,759
conformance checking, you can use and
show these types of things.

63
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,840
Now it's time for a demo that we can
see process discovery in action.

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,130
Let's take a look at an example
of process mining in action.

65
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,110
What I see here is that I load an event
log into the process mining tool ProM, and

66
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,460
I apply one of the standard
process mining algorithms in ProM.

67
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,330
I'm applying the so-called fuzzy miner.

68
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,700
And based on raw event data,
I automatically learn a process model,

69
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,140
as you can see here, and
it goes incredibly fast.

70
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,270
We can zoom in to the model.

71
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,650
We can look at the different activities.

72
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,780
And the arcs connecting
the activities are showing how

73
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,520
cases are flowing through
this process model.

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,840
We can zoom in and zoom out just
like when you use Google Maps.

75
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,780
So now I look at the same process model
at the higher level of abstraction.

76
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,510
We see fewer activities because we
only show the frequent activities at

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,210
the highest level.

78
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,290
We can also replay
reality on such a model.

79
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,800
So I'm now loading both
the model that I discovered and

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,890
the event log, and I'm applying
a so-called replay algorithm on it.

81
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,510
So what you now see is not a simulation.

82
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,080
What you're seeing is that we are
replaying reality on top of this model.

83
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,160
So all the white dots,
refer to real cases.

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,900
What we can see,

85
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,260
you can see the numbers next to the cases,
we can follow individual cases.

86
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,600
We can see all the events.

87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,580
We can see congestion in the process.

88
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,290
We can see frequent paths and
infrequent paths.

89
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,150
And I think this is a very nice
illustration that without any modeling,

90
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,550
you can see what is happening in reality,
through process mining.

91
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,110
So let's take a look at another metaphor

92
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,400
showing what process
discovery is all about.

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,150
You can compare process discovery to
learning a language based on examples.

94
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,460
So here you say see a mother, and the
mother is saying sentences to the child.

95
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,990
So the mother is saying a b c, and
the child is trying to learn the language.

96
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,290
So if the mother would always
say just the words a b and c.

97
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:10,200
The child would think okay, this language
is a b c and that's all that exists.

98
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,994
Then if the mother would say an a b d,
the child will think oh,

99
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:19,710
at the end there is apparently
a choice between c and d.

100
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,100
So, this child is very smart,

101
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,370
thinking already in terms
already of regular expressions.

102
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,930
So, this is the model of
the language that the child infers.

103
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,130
Then mother says another sentence, a d.

104
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,170
So, now the child has to think
what could this language be about?

105
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:45,610
So it's apparently a and d, or
it is a b and then followed by c or d.

106
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,750
Now the mother says, a b b c.

107
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,930
Another example,
trace that we can observe.

108
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,621
And now the child makes
a jump in learning, and

109
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:04,018
infers that apparently the number of b's
is variable, it can be zero or more etc.

110
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:07,343
And so the mother says more words and
if it fits into the language,

111
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:10,310
then the child has a good
understanding of that language.

112
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,120
So, in this example we can see a sentence
and compare that to a trace in

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,250
an event log, and we can think of
the language as a process model.

114
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,410
So, this is the relationship between
understanding a language based on

115
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,659
examples from learning a process model
just by looking at the examples.

116
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,450
What we saw in the last
lecture is that next to

117
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,810
process discovery we also
have conformance checking.

118
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,880
In that case, you want to see how does
reality deviate from the modeled process.

119
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,130
You can compare that to spell checking.

120
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,030
So the spell checker has a model of the
language, and you type a piece of text and

121
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,410
then it is checked,
whether that piece of text

122
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,560
fits the language,
as it has been formalized.

123
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,410
This can be compared to the typical
diagnostics that you get when

124
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,410
you do conformance checking in
the area of process mining.

125
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,310
So you see the activities
that have happened, but

126
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,920
that should not happen,
or the other way around.

127
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,020
Or you will see activities that were
executed too late, or too early, or

128
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,850
by the wrong person.

129
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,020
This can all be compared
by spell checking.

130
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,340
So in the remainder of this week,
we will focus on the topic of Data Mining.

131
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,630
As I have explained, also in the previous
lecture, process mining is very different

132
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,440
from the classical data mining techniques,
but there are many relationships.

133
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,610
So in this course, you will also get a
basic understanding of what process mining

134
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,690
is all about and
of course also data mining.

135
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,130
So, the growth of the digital universe

136
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,190
is driving the fact that many people
are using data mining techniques.

137
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,520
Initially the term data mining
had a very negative connotation.

138
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,770
People talked about it as data snooping,
fishing, etc.

139
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,930
Statisticians did not consider
it the proper way to do, but

140
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,470
this is now a very mature discipline
driven by these huge amounts of data.

141
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,761
But data mining is data-centric and
not process-centric.

142
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,902
So let us take a look at
some typical data sets, and

143
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:34,650
then try to think what data mining can do.

144
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,650
So, what you see here, is a data
set of more than 800 persons that

145
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:46,090
have died at a particular age while
having a particular weight and

146
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,340
it was recorded whether they
were drinking or smoking.

147
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:56,280
So for example, the first row corresponds
to a person that died at the age of 44

148
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,510
while being a drinker and a smoker and
having a weight of 120 kilos.

149
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,270
So this is an example of a data set.

150
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,910
And the types of questions that you can
ask about such a data set are things like,

151
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,450
do people that smoke also drink.

152
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,850
When do people get old.

153
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,190
What kind of properties
do they have in common?

154
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,350
The people typically that, that get old.

155
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,630
So what is the impact
of a certain lifestyle,

156
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,310
on the life
expectancy of a person?

157
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,580
So this is one data set and
typical data mining questions.

158
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,700
This is another data set.

159
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,070
And every row now corresponds
to a student at the university.

160
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:47,680
And what we see here are different
columns referring to different courses.

161
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,390
We can see the marks that people got for
each of these courses.

162
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,290
We can see the duration of
their studies in months, and

163
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,120
we can see whether they passed,
failed, or graduated cum laude.

164
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,330
So again, if we have such a data set
we can ask all kinds of questions.

165
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:12,580
So, are there certain courses that
are typically taken together, or

166
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,819
do marks of different
courses highly correlate?

167
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,810
If people fail,

168
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,360
what are the typical courses that
are leading to such a failure.

169
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,270
When and why do people drop out?

170
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,391
It's a different type of analysis that
you can do based on such a data set.

171
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,800
But we can look at all
kinds of other data sets.

172
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,240
So here you can see the
different orders in a cafe.

173
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,775
So every row refers to an order,
so if you look at the first row,

174
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:51,005
you see a person that has ordered
a cappuccino and a muffin.

175
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,466
So every row corresponds to an order, and

176
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:56,220
again you can try to learn
all kinds of things.

177
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,907
So, you can try to find out
which are the products which

178
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:03,370
are typically purchased together.

179
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,060
You could try to find out
are there characteristic groups of

180
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,990
customers that typically
consume similar things.

181
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,750
And all of this can be used
to try to promote sales.

182
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:23,160
So these three data sets give all kinds
of examples for data mining problems.

183
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,730
So if you look at the raw data that
we get in each of these examples.

184
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,670
Is we, if I get a table, every row in
the table corresponds to an instance.

185
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,240
And every column in the table
refers to a variable,

186
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,830
often called attribute or
feature or data element.

187
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,790
If we look at these variables, these
columns, then we can find two main groups.

188
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,160
Numerical variables that
refer to a number, like for

189
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,660
example an age or a weight.

190
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,250
And categorical variables that don't
have a value that is a number,

191
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,270
but these are values
taken from a smaller set.

192
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,560
So for example, cum laude passed or
failed or true and

193
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,120
false are examples of
categorical variables.

194
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,940
If they have an order,
they're called ordinal.

195
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,510
If not, they are called nominal.

196
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,000
So these are the variables, the columns
that we see in a data mining problem.

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,800
So, to check whether you
understood what I just explained,

198
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,390
take a look at this data set.

199
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,970
And my question is, what columns refer
to ordinal categorical variables,

200
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,090
which to nominal categorical variables,
and which ones are numerical variables?

201
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,210
So please think about this for a minute.

202
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,900
So the answer to question is that,
there are two categorical variables.

203
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,830
Referring to the first two columns
where the people are a drinker or

204
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,230
a smoker, these are not numbers and
they are nominal because true and

205
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,400
false do not have some natural order.

206
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,290
There are two numerical variables,
the weight and

207
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,279
the age because they refer to a number.

208
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,210
There are two types of
data mining techniques,

209
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,810
generally referred to as supervised
learning and unsupervised learning.

210
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,980
In the context of supervised learning,
we have labeled data.

211
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,670
Labeled data means that
there is a response variable

212
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,350
that labels the instance.

213
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,160
And the goal of supervised learning is
to learn from the other variables that

214
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,210
are called predictor variables,
what our response variable is going to be.

215
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,400
So instead of response variable,

216
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,530
we also talk about dependent variables.

217
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,940
And instead of predictor variables we
also talked about independent variables.

218
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,173
And the goal is to explain
the dependent variable in terms of

219
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,798
the independent variables.

220
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,846
So, classification techniques,

221
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:14,910
like learning decision trees,
aim to answer such questions.

222
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,880
So what is the class depending on
the set of variables that we know.

223
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,740
If the response variable is numerical,
we typically use regression techniques.

224
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,800
And then the goal is to find
the function that explains

225
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,850
the response variable in terms
of these other variables.

226
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,926
So, let's take a look at this data set.

227
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:44,580
So, from every instance,
it refers to a person, and we know

228
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,870
whether the person was drinking or not,
smoking or not, and we know their weight.

229
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,870
We would like to learn
the influence of drinking and

230
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,130
smoking on somebody's body weight.

231
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,130
If you have that question, and

232
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,900
you think of supervised learning, what
are the response and predictor variables?

233
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,980
I think the answer to this
question is relatively easy.

234
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,940
In this particular example
the response variable is the weight.

235
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,190
And we would like to explain the response
variable in the predictor variables,

236
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,860
whether people are drinking or smoking.

237
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,190
Next to supervised learning we also
have unsupervised learning, and

238
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,900
now the data is unlabeled.

239
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,240
In other words,
we don't have response variables.

240
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,740
And the typical techniques that you
will then look at are clustering and

241
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,480
pattern discovery.

242
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,010
So you want to find homogeneous
groups of for example patients or

243
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,260
customers, without aiming to look
at a particular response variable.

244
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,730
And these are just some examples of

245
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,710
the many data mining
questions that you can ask.

246
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,060
And in the next lectures we will zoom in
to some of these questions and I will

247
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:12,550
teach you hands on knowledge to
solve these types of problems.

248
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,650
There are many data mining tools
available, you can see some of them here.

249
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,060
In my next lectures,

250
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:25,000
I will use RapidMiner to illustrate
these classical data mining techniques.

251
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,110
You don't have to install RapidMiner for
this course, but if you want,

252
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,830
you can do and you can repeat
experiments that I will show.

253
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,460
There are many differences between
process mining and data mining.

254
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,260
Let me repeat some of the things.

255
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,750
In what way are they common and
in what way are they different?

256
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,100
They both start from data, but data mining
techniques are not process-centric.

257
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,730
They look at isolated decisions of
the type that I've just shown to you.

258
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,780
Topics such as process discovery,
conformance checking,

259
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,895
bottleneck analysis and all the other
things that I showed in the previous

260
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:11,125
lecture, cannot be done using
traditional data mining techniques.

261
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,985
So you need to have process mining for
that.

262
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,040
End-to-end process models are crucial.

263
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,400
And when you want to discover end-to-end
process models, concurrency is important.

264
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,410
So when we
will talk about process models,

265
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,970
we will deal with the topic of
concurrency, because it's very important.

266
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:36,610
Process mining assumes a different type of
data than the data that we have just seen.

267
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,860
We assume that we can see events.

268
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,410
These events they have timestamps and
they refer to cases.

269
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,850
And that is a crucial difference with
the data the three data sets that I

270
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,800
showed you before.

271
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,230
But, process mining and
data mining can be combined to answer very

272
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,460
advanced questions,
so that's very important.

273
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,830
If you would like to learn
more about data mining and

274
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,880
in the next lectures we will discuss
some of the techniques in more detail,

275
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,630
please read chapter three
of the Process Mining book.

276
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,051
Thank you for watching,
and hope to see you soon.

277
