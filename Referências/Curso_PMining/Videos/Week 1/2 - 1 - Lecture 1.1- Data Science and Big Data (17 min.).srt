00:00:07,295 --> 00:00:11,599
Welcome to this first lecture of
the course on Process Mining: Data Science

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,280
in Action.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,120
In this first week, we focus on the
relationship between Process Mining and

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,430
other types of data analytics.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,220
Today, I start by discussing the broader
topic of Data Science and Big Data.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,230
Today, many people say
data is the big oil.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,582
And this is illustrating the incredible
amount of data that we are collecting and

9
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:35,060
the corresponding value.

10
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:41,319
If you would think about, how much data
was generated from pre-historic times,

11
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,290
until 2003.

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,830
And we think, what we can now do it at.

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,150
We are able to generate such
amounts of data in just 10 minutes.

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,950
So, in 10 minutes,
we are generating, as much data now.

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,620
As we were doing from
prehistoric times until 2003.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,710
So this is 

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,110
illustrating the incredible
growth of data.

18
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,160
So, what kind of data is this?

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,675
What kind of event data are we generating?

20
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:11,340
Well, we are generating, when we buy
a cup of coffee with our credit card.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,800
When we make a phone call,
we are generating data.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,040
When we are getting a speeding ticket.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,590
And there are many other examples,

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,830
as you can see on this slide, showing
that we are generating all the time.

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,000
Even while, you are watching this MOOC,
you are generating data.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,860
Because all kinds of
things are being recorded.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,640
If you take another example and you look
at the simple telephone that now these

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,310
days everybody owns, then you can see that
such a phone has many different sensors.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,190
There is a GPS sensor, telling you where
you are, but there are many other sensors,

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,420
for example, looking at your fingerprint,
and stuff like that.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,590
These are all generating data, and

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,130
therefore we are talking
about the Internet of Events.

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,040
All the data that is being
recorded in all kinds of ways.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,220
Let's look at this Internet
of Events in more detail.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,530
What does it consist of?

36
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,780
One can talk about 4 different
sources of event data.

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,390
The first source of event data.

38
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,420
Is the Internet of Content.

39
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,395
This is the classical Internet that we
know, from Google and Wikipedia and

40
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:27,790
then people typically, talk about Big Data
they are talking about this Internet.

41
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,340
But next to this classical
Internet of Content,

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,650
we now also have an Internet People.

43
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,670
So we have Twitter messages.

44
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,880
We have Facebook.

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,270
All kinds of events,
social events that are generating data.

46
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,100
Then we have the Internet of Things.

47
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,560
It's another source of event data.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,000
Today already many devices
are connected to the internet but

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,430
in the future many more devices
will be connected to the Internet.

50
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,690
For example your shaving device.

51
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,990
Your refrigerator, everything in
the future will be connected to

52
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,690
the Internet and
this will generate large amounts of data.

53
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,030
Last but not least, there is the Internet
of Places, when you are using your mobile

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,700
phone, as I just illustrated, the phone
contains all kinds of sensors that are

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,170
recording, where you are and

56
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,950
what you are doing and
this is another source of information.

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,780
So, this is why today many people talk,
about Big Data.

58
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,160
Incredible amounts of event
data that are being recorded.

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,830
When people talk about Big Data.

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,340
Talk about the exponential growth of data.

61
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,260
This picture looks very complicated but
don't be scared of by it.

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,120
It is showing the exponential growth
of the number of transistors on a chip.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,540
And this was predicted by
the founder of Intel, Moore, and

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,530
we can see that this exponential growth
has continued over the last 40 years.

65
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,220
Every 2 years, the numbers of
transistors on a chip is doubling, so

66
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,340
that means that on a chip now there
are 1 million times the number of

67
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,060
Transistors as there was 40 years ago.

68
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,450
We not only see this in terms
of the number of transistors but

69
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,310
also in terms of computing speed.

70
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,480
The capacity of a hard disk and the number
of bytes, you get for a Dollar or Euro.

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,780
And so
this is showing this incredible growth.

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,970
If other fields would have
had the same growth of data,

73
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,490
we would see very surprising things.

74
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,820
For example, if I take the train.

75
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,027
From Eindhoven to Amsterdam, 40 years ago,
this would take approximately 1.5 hours.

76
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,780
The question is now, if transportation
would have followed more Moore's law,

77
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,890
how fast would we be able to go from
Eindhoven to Amsterdam by train today?

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,230
Please think about this question.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,740
The answer to the question can
be computed in a very easy way.

80
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,540
We take one and a half hours times
60 minutes times 60 seconds and

81
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,720
divide it by 2 to the power 20.

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,060
And we would see that today we would

83
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,430
only need 5 milliseconds to travel
from Eindhoven to Amsterdam.

84
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,120
We can look at another example,
do exactly the same calculation.

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,410
If we would fly, from Amsterdam to
New York 40 years ago

86
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,650
it would take seven hours.

87
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,610
How long would it take today,

88
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,780
if transportation would
have followed Moore's law?

89
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,000
We can do exactly the same calculation.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,240
We take the number of hours.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,870
Times 60 minutes, times 60 seconds,
divided by 2 to the power 20.

92
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,620
And we would see that
only in 24 milliseconds,

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,790
we would be able to fly
from Amsterdam to New York.

94
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,790
As I said, the capacity on the hard
disk is also growing exponentially.

95
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,050
And also the costs per
byte are also

96
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,700
decreasing exponentially.

97
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,170
So what does this mean?

98
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,800
Let's compare it to fuel consumption.

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,790
If 40 years ago, we needed 4000 liters of
petrol to drive a car around the world,

100
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,630
how much petrol would we need today if
we would have followed Moore's Law?

101
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,040
The answer to this question.

102
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,510
Can be computed in exactly
the same way.

103
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:38,750
We take 4000 liters divided by 2 to
the power 20 and we would see that 4

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,410
milliliters of petrol would be sufficient
to travel all around the world.

105
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,850
These examples are showing
the incredible, growth of the data and

106
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,450
why people talk about Big Data.

107
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,440
The challenge today is not
to generate more data, but

108
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,850
the challenge today is to turn
this data into real value.

109
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,000
And this is a crucial topic.

110
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,990
People often talk about
the four V's of Big Data.

111
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,610
The first V.

112
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,110
I just explained that is the v of Volume.

113
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,310
So we are generating incredible amounts of
data, but that's not the only challenge.

114
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,440
The second challenge is Velocity.

115
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,850
We are not only generating large
amounts of data, data is

116
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,030
continuously being added.

117
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,650
And things are changing very rapidly.

118
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,920
So, velocity is the second challenge.

119
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,510
The third challenge is Variety.

120
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,470
So it's not one type of data.

121
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,130
We are confronted with many
different types of data.

122
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,950
Ranging from text,
to images, to audit trails.

123
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,740
And we need to combine all these
different sources of information.

124
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,940
Last but not least,
a problem of Big Data is Veracity.

125
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,870
And that means, that you can not be
completely sure that what you have

126
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,420
recorded is completely accurate.

127
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,950
For example, your shaving device of the
future will have an Internet connection.

128
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,550
Somebody has bought that shaving device.

129
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,700
And we are recording events from
that device, how it is being used.

130
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,740
But can we be sure that the person
who purchased the shaving

131
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,330
device is the actual person using it?

132
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,440
That is a kind of uncertainty that you see
if you collect data in a very large scale.

133
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,080
And you need to be able to deal with that.

134
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,340
I just spoke a lot about Big Data,

135
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,310
but data doesn't have to
be big to be challenging.

136
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,850
Data analytics questions
are everywhere and

137
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,980
that is why there is a very urgent
demand for data scientists.

138
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,870
So, what do these data scientists do?

139
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,940
What is their profession?

140
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,870
What is their task?

141
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,280
Well, their goal is to collect,
analyze, and

142
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,510
interpret data from a variety of sources.

143
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,620
I've given you already several examples.

144
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,320
That is why this will become a very
important profession in the future.

145
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,860
And the main goal is to
turn data into value.

146
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,030
And in this course,
we will focus on this particularity,

147
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,810
If you look at data science there
are 4 generic data science questions,

148
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,720
that you can ask in any situation.

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,630
The first data science
question is the question.

150
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,260
What happened?

151
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,870
If we see a bottle neck, if we see
deviations, we record event data and

152
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,850
we can actually,
see that these things have happened.

153
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,140
Then the second logical question,
is to ask yourself.

154
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,690
Why did it happen?

155
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,350
Why was there this delay?

156
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,630
Why did people deviate
from the expected path?

157
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,550
These things are just about the past, but

158
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,150
of course data science also aims to
answer questions about the future.

159
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,120
So, if you look at the future.

160
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,370
You also ask yourself the question,
what will happen?

161
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,650
What can we learn from historic
information to make predictions,

162
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,620
about what is happening at this
point in time. And then last, but

163
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,080
not least,
the fourth question of data science.

164
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,720
Is to ask yourself,
what is the best that can happen?

165
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,960
So, you want to use analytics
to recommend certain things that

166
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,040
will improve a situation.

167
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,630
Remove a bottleneck.

168
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,580
Make sure that people don't deviate or
provide a better service.

169
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,150
So these are the four questions
of data science.

170
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,820
And if we look for
example at the care flows in

171
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,950
a hospital we can as ourselves
some of these questions.

172
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,550
So for example, a hospital you
could ask yourself the question.

173
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,990
Why do patients have to wait so long?

174
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,520
What is causing these delays?

175
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,440
Do doctors follow the guidelines?

176
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,350
We have been doing a lot of analysis
in hospitals, and we see that

177
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,880
different doctors typically, process
things in a completely different way.

178
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,260
So why does one person do something
different than another person?

179
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,490
Can we predict waiting times for patients?

180
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,150
Can we predict how much
staff we will need tomorrow?

181
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,070
And last but not least,
very important in health care,

182
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,700
how can we reduce costs
without sacrificing quality?

183
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,800
So these questions are at, a level
of what we call a business process.

184
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,290
But even if you look at
the technical device, like for

185
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,560
example an X-ray machine in
exactly the same hospital,

186
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,870
we can also see that this X-ray
machine is generating lots of data.

187
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,130
And again, we can ask all
kinds of questions which you

188
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,510
can answer by analysing
this data carefully.

189
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,920
So for example.

190
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,850
How are the X-ray machines,
really used in the field?

191
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,750
There's a very important, question for
the people making these machines.

192
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,800
Why and
when do X-ray machines malfunction?

193
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,760
When do they break down, and why?

194
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,690
Which components should be replaced?

195
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,160
The machine doesn't work anymore.

196
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,650
Can we generate

197
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,250
diagnostic information telling
us which component is broken, so

198
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,650
that an engineer can go to the device and
repair it instantly.

199
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,960
Can we predict,
whether a machine will break down?

200
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,660
And last but not least, can we learn from

201
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,820
existing problems,
which parts need to be improved?

202
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,000
So these,
are all Data science questions and

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,490
you need very different skills to
address all of these questions.

204
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,050
So this picture tries to summarize
the various skills that are important for

205
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,690
data science.

206
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,730
There are obvious candidates
like Statistics and Data Mining.

207
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,450
You also need to be able to
visualize large amounts of data.

208
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,400
You need to be able to deal with
incredibly large databases.

209
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,890
But that's not the only thing.

210
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,180
You also need,

211
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,920
to have knowledge of social sciences to
talk about things like ethics and privacy.

212
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,410
You need to think about the value of data,
how you can extract value from it.

213
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,540
So Industrial Engineering
is also important.

214
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,250
And last but not least, and
that the core topic of this course,

215
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,810
you want to apply Process Mining
techniques to these data, to learn and

216
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,379
improve processes in the way
that I just described.

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,800
So the importance of Data science,
hopefully is obvious.

218
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,310
Many people say the Data scientist will
be the most sexy job of this century.

219
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,360
And that is why in Eindhoven we have
started The Data Science Center Eindhoven,

220
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,770
which groups specialists in the area.

221
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,620
And educate students in this exciting
new topic.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,940
So far, I've been mainly talk about
Data science in a very general sense.

223
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,570
This course is about Data science,
but in particular, we will focus on

224
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,710
the analysis on process is based on data.

225
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,290
Processes are key.

226
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,120
You don't want to improve data.

227
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,550
You want to improve processes.

228
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,340
They are the thing that matter.

229
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,290
Not the data.

230
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,090
Not the software.

231
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,120
It's also different from data mining.

232
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,780
We are not interested in just isolated
decisions or low level patterns.

233
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,950
We are interested in improving
end-to-end processes.

234
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,930
That is a key thing.

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,860
So if you take this Process-centric
view on data science, and we

236
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,400
return to the examples that I gave before,
we can see that in a hospital setting,

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,109
there are many process related questions
that we can ask about care flows.

238
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,040
If we go to an X-ray machine,

239
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,490
we can see that in such a machine
there are many processes unfolding.

240
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,570
And you would like to analyze and
understand them.

241
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,210
And they are generating
terrabytes of data.

242
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,760
So we have a rich
source of information to do so.

243
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,930
So the focus of this course is on
the interplay between event data and

244
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,030
processes and process models.

245
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,300
And that is what the topic
of process mining, or

246
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,970
some people refer to it as business
process intelligence, is all about.

247
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,849
And so that is what we will focus
on in the next couple of weeks.

248
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,060
Let me sketch some use
cases for process mining.

249
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,850
The first use case is to
ask yourself the question,

250
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,610
what is the process that
people really follow?

251
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,140
What do they really do?

252
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,700
Not what they tell they do,
but what do they really do?

253
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,450
What are the bottlenecks?

254
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,500
Where are they?

255
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,560
What is causing them?

256
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,750
Where and why, do people or

257
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,020
machines deviate from an expected or
an idealized process?

258
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,850
These are key questions and
these are just a few examples.

259
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,580
There are many more examples.

260
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,080
What are the highways in my process?

261
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,040
Which factors are influencing
a bottleneck, etcetera.

262
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,220
And so these are the questions that we
will focus on in the next couple of weeks.

263
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,960
So, Process Mining is
Data Science in Action.

264
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,380
We are looking at
the dynamics of machines and

265
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,500
business processes and
try to learn from them and improve them.

266
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,470
So, if you want to read more about
this topic of Process Mining,

267
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,640
I would advise you to read chapter one of
the process mining book, and you will

268
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,990
will be able to
learn much more about this.

269
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,895
Thank you for watching and
hope to see you soon.

270
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:47,396
