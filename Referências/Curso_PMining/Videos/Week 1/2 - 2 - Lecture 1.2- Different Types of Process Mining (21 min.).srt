2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,042
Welcome to the second
lecture of the course on

3
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:12,920
process mining data science in action.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,990
Today I provide an overview of
process mining by discussing three

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,430
types of mining.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,190
Process discovery,
performance checking, and enhancement.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,020
In my last lecture, I showed you that
we have large amounts of data, but

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,390
that it is not just about collecting data,
it's about analyzing processes.

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,100
That is one of the key things.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,730
If you think about what process mining is,

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,710
then the next diagram provides
a nice illustration of that.

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,310
So process mining is bridging the gap
between classical process model analysis.

13
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,025
And data oriented analysis like
data mining and machine learning.

14
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,870
Process mining
is bridging this gap,

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,920
because it's focusing on processes.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,420
But at the same time, using the real data.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,210
In classical data mining,
people typically do not look at processes.

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,050
Especially not end to end processes.

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,980
In areas where people are concerned
with process model analysis,

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,180
they typically ignore the data.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,440
Why are you doing process mining?

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,288
We are doing process mining to answer
performance related questions and

23
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:27,380
compliance related questions.

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,890
So why are there certain bottlenecks,

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,190
how can they be removed,
why do people deviate.

26
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,500
So the starting point for
process mining is event data.

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,350
What you see here is a table, and every
row in this table corresponds to an event.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,640
An event has different properties, so
there are generic types of properties.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,640
The first property is a case id.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,090
In this case every record refers
to a student making an exam.

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,840
So the case id refers to the student.

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,900
The activity name refers to the exam.

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,230
And the timestamp in this
case is the date of the exam.

34
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,660
There can be additional data like, for

35
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,150
example, the mark, or
the grade that somebody got.

36
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,250
Let's take another example.

37
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,120
We are now looking at
the handling of orders.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,790
Again every line, corresponds to an event.

39
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,760
If here we look at the first column,
we see the order number.

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
That is the case id.

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,590
The second column refers to
the activity that is being executed.

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,030
The third column,
again refers to the timestamp.

43
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,250
Then there is a column
referring to the resource.

44
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,360
The person executing
the corresponding activity.

45
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,240
And we can have all kinds of other columns
with other data like the products and

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,760
quantity and things like that.

47
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,150
Let's take a look at the third example.

48
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,940
Now we are in a hospital
we are treating patients.

49
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,600
And we look at an event log and

50
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,700
every row refers to a step in
the treatment of a particular patient.

51
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,120
So what you see is that, again, we see
a case id, activity name, and timestamp.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,240
So the first column refers to the patient,
this case represented by a number.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,160
The second column to the activity name,
the third column to the timestamp.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,010
Again we see the resource,
in this case the doctor or

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,290
the nurse executing a particular activity,
and we can have all kinds of other data.

56
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,270
Like for example the age of the patient.

57
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,870
And all kinds of other properties of
the patient or the corresponding step.

58
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,400
So these are examples
of the kind of

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,120
event data that we would like to use for
analysis.

60
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,270
And we are focusing on the relationship
between process models and event data.

61
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,060
And I will talk about three types
of relationships between models and

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,816
event data.

63
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:05,190
Play-out, Play-in, and Replay.

64
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,260
Let's first take a look at Play-out.

65
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,480
Here the basic idea is that you start
from a model, and from that model,

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,960
you generate behavior.

67
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,990
And let me try to illustrate
this using a small example.

68
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,780
What you see here is
a so-called BPMN model.

69
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,320
And don't be scared off by it.

70
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,830
In later weeks we will discuss
these types of things in detail but

71
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,210
this model is describing
a particular work flow.

72
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,270
How things are executed, and
in what order they are being executed.

73
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,830
So, if we take one execution
of this process model,

74
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,368
which is about handling travel requests,

75
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:52,300
then it always starts with an activity a,
where we register the travel request.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,620
It is done at a particular point in time,
and it is done by a particular person.

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,480
Then we start concurrently two paths.

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,470
In one path we execute activity d,
check budget.

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,870
And in another path we have a choice
between two different activities, b and c.

80
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,250
So let's assume that we do activity b,
get support from local manager.

81
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,990
And this is done at the particular
time and by a particular person.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,090
Then, we have to do activity
d if we follow this model.

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,720
Check budget by finance.

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,750
Again, done at a particular point
in time by a particular person.

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,550
And then,
we can make a decision doing activity e.

86
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,790
Here we see an XOR-split.

87
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,800
So we need to make one of three
decisions accept, reject or there is

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,630
insufficient information and
we need to redo part of the process again.

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,520
If we decide to accept, we execute
activity g and the process ends.

90
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,380
So this is one possible scenario.

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,830
Let us now look at another possible
scenario following the same process.

92
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:13,170
So we first do an a we then,
again start two paths in parallel.

93
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:18,190
But now we do first d and
then we do c instead of b.

94
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,300
We then have to make a decision again.

95
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,000
But now there is not enough information.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,960
We need to go back.

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,980
And if we go backwards, we
again need to execute d and b or c.

98
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,110
So we go back.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,180
We execute b again.

100
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,130
We execute d.

101
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,440
Then we execute e.

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,270
And finally we make a decision.

103
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,250
And in this case the decision
is to reject the request.

104
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,640
So this shows you two possible paths.

105
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,370
But there are many more.

106
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,850
Now if we look at this process model
then these are possible ways of

107
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,050
playing out this model.

108
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,390
These are not the only ones because there
is a loop that are infinitely many.

109
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,450
So this is playing out a model.

110
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,710
And if you are using simulation or if you
are building an information system that

111
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,580
is driven by such models,
play-out is the thing that you are doing.

112
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,220
Let's now look at the reverse.

113
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,630
We are just reversing the arrow.

114
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,130
We now go from even data to
the corresponding process model.

115
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,240
And in later weeks we will look at
different algorithms to do this.

116
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,410
The basic idea is you look at
the number of example behaviors.

117
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,490
And you automatically
infer a model from it.

118
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,420
So here, if you look at the process,
if you look at the traces that you

119
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,030
see on top of this diagram, you can
see that it always starts with an a.

120
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,900
So we infer a model that
always starts with an a.

121
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,760
All the traces end with a g or and h, so

122
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,130
in the process model at the end there is a
choice between accept and reject, g and h.

123
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,350
This is a more complicated set of traces
and if we get this more complicated set of

124
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,780
traces, we get this
more complicated model.

125
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,330
So we are automatically
learning a model from examples.

126
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,540
And what is very important to understand
here is that no modeling is needed.

127
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,400
We are not making any models by hand.

128
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,490
We automatically infer
process models from

129
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,530
raw event data.

130
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,810
So let me ask you a question.

131
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,330
And of course you did not learn yet
process discovery techniques.

132
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,120
And later you will look
at algorithms to do so.

133
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,810
But take a look at these example traces.

134
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,220
And I ask you, can you create
a process model that allows for

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,480
the traces that you see here.

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,250
Think a bit about this for sometime.

137
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,190
And I'm quite sure that you probably
end up with a model like this.

138
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,540
So what is shown in this model.

139
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,230
That all the traces started with a.

140
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,110
And ends with an e or an f.

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,740
And in between we again have a choice
between B and C and we always do D.

142
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,580
And this can be done in any order that is
why we have an AND-split in this diagram.

143
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,770
So that was a toy example, we can
easily apply this to real world data.

144
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,630
So here you see an example.

145
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,800
That we will revisit several times
in the future.

146
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,070
Here we look at raw event data
from a Dutch housing agency.

147
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,630
And every row refers to an event
within this housing agency.

148
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:55,740
The first column refers to the number of
an apartment, the ID of an apartment.

149
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,900
The second column to the activity.

150
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,860
The third column to the time stamp.

151
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,360
Again, very similar to the things
that we have seen before.

152
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:11,600
If we take this raw event data, we infer
a process model that is describing

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,150
what happens when somebody that is
renting an apartment, cancels his rent.

154
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,510
Until the moment that apartment
is rented out to somebody else.

155
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,580
This is the full process model.

156
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,730
If we zoom into a particular part,
then you can see

157
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:33,360
a small fragment which is executed by,
let's say, approximately thirty, cases.

158
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,100
This case houses or apartments that
followed this sequential path.

159
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,680
Without modeling you are able to
see what is the process that is

160
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,730
really being executed.

161
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,370
Let's take a look at a more
complicated example.

162
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,670
We have been applying
this in probably 20 to

163
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,050
30 different hospitals where we can
take event data about patients.

164
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,480
So this is a homogeneous group of
patients within a Dutch hospital.

165
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,700
We can look at the audit trail of
a single patient of that patient,

166
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,170
we see all kinds of properties, and
we see the events that have been executed.

167
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,730
If we take 600 of such cases.

168
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,670
And we automatically infer a model.

169
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,630
We see this scary diagram
that you can see on one side.

170
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,350
It is showing that a treatment process of

171
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,320
this particular group of patients
is incredibly complicated.

172
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,810
Don't be scared off by this
spaghetti like diagram.

173
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,280
Later we will see all kinds of techniques
to simplify such diagrams, so that you

174
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,590
only have to look at the highways, or
the parts that you're interested in.

175
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:52,140
On the right-hand side of the screen,
you see also a graph-based model,

176
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,990
but it is now not showing activities,
but it is showing departments.

177
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,480
So rather than seeing the sequence from
one activity to the next activity we now

178
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
see how work is flowing from one
department to another department.

179
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,480
So these are some practical
examples showing you

180
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
how process mining can
be applied in practice.

181
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,850
But it doesn't stop here.

182
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,640
It is not enough to just learn the model,

183
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,240
the key element is that you can
replay a reality on top of models.

184
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,770
Whether you have made
these models by hand, or

185
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,780
whether you have automatically learned
them using process discovery is irrelevant.

186
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,560
What is important is that you try to
replay reality on top of the model.

187
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,220
So, at the top of the slide, you can
see a trace that happened in reality.

188
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,460
Again, this is an abstract example,
later I will show you a real example.

189
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,670
In reality, we saw the sequence a c d e g.

190
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,630
Let's try to replay this on this model.

191
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,860
And if we do this, we see a path through
the process model that is indeed possible.

192
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,520
So we replay reality on top of the model,

193
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,830
and while doing that we don't
encounter any problems.

194
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,520
So, nothing surprising yet
Let's now take a look at another case.

195
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,430
Where we see the sequence a c e g.

196
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,240
So this could be the path of a patient.

197
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,710
This could be the life
cycle of an apartment.

198
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,510
It could be somebody applying for
a mortgage.

199
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,520
It can be anything.

200
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,940
So we look a the sequence of events.

201
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,790
In this case in reality first a happens.

202
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,330
That is possible according to the model.

203
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:42,710
Then c happens, this is also
still possible in the model but

204
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,540
then in the reality e happened, and

205
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,910
according to the process model you can
only make a decision if also activity d

206
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,530
is being executed it is impossible
to execute d at this point in time.

207
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:03,310
So while replaying, we continue, but we
record the fact that there is a problem.

208
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,400
So here activity d,
check budget, is missing.

209
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,060
And then we continue and
in the remainder of the trace,

210
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,580
we don't see any surprising things.

211
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,830
So we can see where the deviations are.

212
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,820
Here I show you another example.

213
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,270
If we look at this example
first a then we do a c then

214
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,360
we see that in
reality h has happened.

215
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,830
So there was a rejection while
the process was still in the middle.

216
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,340
Again by doing replay we
can record a problem.

217
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,940
Provide diagnostics and
continue our replay.

218
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,940
This case, we make a decision and
finally we do the acceptance.

219
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,870
So again, we have found a deviation
between the reality and the model.

220
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,120
So, to check whether you have
understood these types of things.

221
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,900
Take a look at this model and
the corresponding tree traces.

222
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,290
Are these traces possible in this model or
not?

223
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,860
And if they are not possible, where
does reality deviate from this model?

224
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,540
Let's take a look at the answer.

225
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,740
If we take a look at the first trace.

226
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,840
a, b, d, c, e h.

227
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,230
Then we can see that this is impossible.

228
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,770
If we tried to replay it, we will see
that it is impossible to do both b and c.

229
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:39,470
When we take a look at the second trace,
we find kind of a reversed problem.

230
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,860
Now we don't have an activity too
much we have an activity too little.

231
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,150
Activity d is missing.

232
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,020
So it doesn't fit.

233
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,750
If you try to replay the last
trace you will see that you

234
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,140
don't encounter any problems so
indeed it is replayable.

235
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,380
So these examples show you
how you can apply yourself.

236
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,320
Conformance checking
techniques by doing replay.

237
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,990
Again, let us take a look
at a practical example.

238
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,090
This is a fragment of
a larger process model,

239
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,870
describing the handling of
complaints in a Dutch municipality.

240
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,700
These are people that are complaining
about the valuation of their house.

241
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,360
And because of that, they think
that they need to pay too much tax.

242
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
We take a look at this process and

243
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:35,370
we replay a reality on top of this model,
we will find interesting deviations.

244
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,410
Although the overall process
has a very good fitness,

245
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,170
the relationship between reality and
the model.

246
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,130
They are very close to one another.

247
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,640
We still find all kind of
interesting deviations.

248
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,910
So for example here the house
was reevaluated 23 times.

249
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,460
While it was not supposed to happen.

250
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,570
So something happened in reality.

251
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,330
Which was not possible
according to the model.

252
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,710
And by replaying reality on top of the
model, we can see these types of problems.

253
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,790
Replay is not just about conformance.

254
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,050
It's also about performance analysis.

255
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,040
We can easily replay an event logged that
has timestamps on top of such a model.

256
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,330
And each time we execute an activity.

257
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,700
We record the corresponding time
as you can see here on this slide.

258
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,460
So we just execute reality
on top of the model.

259
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,450
We record all the times.

260
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,940
And at the end we know exactly
how much time was spent in

261
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,250
all the different parts of the process.

262
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,870
And the black circles here indicate
delays between individual activities.

263
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,690
So we can do this for
a single execution, for a single trace.

264
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,220
But you can also do that for many traces.

265
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,850
If you do that for

266
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,580
many traces, you will see how often
an activity is being executed.

267
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,470
You will see how often a particular
path is being followed.

268
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,780
But you also see how long
activities have taken and

269
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,320
you will see what the delays
are in between these activities.

270
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,590
What are waiting times.

271
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,740
What are synchronization times.

272
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,690
You can record them for
hundreds of thousands or

273
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,290
perhaps even millions of cases.

274
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,320
And derive probability
distribution from them.

275
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,810
So again let us take a look
at a practical example.

276
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,350
Here we look again at a process
where people complain about

277
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,390
the valuation of their house.

278
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,020
We have derived automatically
a process model.

279
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,870
And these terms expressed as a petri net.

280
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,000
And now we can by replaying we
can see where the delays take place.

281
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,890
So if you look at this slide you can
see that certain places are

282
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,260
indicated in purple.

283
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,880
And these are the places
where we see a large delay.

284
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,879
So this is an indication where
possible performance problems are.

285
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,940
It can go one step further.

286
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,270
You can point at two arbitrary
points in the process.

287
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,550
You can see how many cases, in this case
how many objections are flowing from

288
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,960
this first red activity to the second red
activity, and we can see how long it took.

289
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,160
And you can see here
the corresponding statistics.

290
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,270
So by replaying you can see
exactly where delays take place.

291
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,980
You can start investigating
what is causing them.

292
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:43,280
So to provide an overview of
the things that I've been talking about

293
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,890
we have a real world where
things are happening.

294
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,050
We have a software system, that is,

295
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,420
somehow, recording events of
the things that take place.

296
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,320
People objecting to
the valuation of their house.

297
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,820
Patients being treated in a hospital.

298
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,090
Then we have these event data.

299
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,660
And we can do discovery,
automatically learning process models.

300
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,760
We can do conformance checking.

301
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,120
Comparing the event log
to the process model and

302
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,920
we can enrich, it's called enhancement here,
we can enrich the process

303
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,620
model with information about
deviations and performance.

304
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,650
For example the bottle necks
that I just showed you.

305
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,525
How does that relate to
the things that I've been talking about?

306
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,460
Play-out is about the classical use of

307
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,405
process models not
involving any event data.

308
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:40,540
Play-in corresponds to discovery.

309
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,580
You automatically learn a process model
without any modeling from raw event data.

310
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,250
And you have replay where you compare
a process model to an event log

311
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:56,420
to check conformance, to investigate
performance problems, etcetera.

312
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,370
So, I hope this gave you a good overview
of the three different types of,

313
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,240
process mining.

314
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,050
If you want to find more high-level
information about these three types,

315
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,490
please read chapter one.

316
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,695
Thank you very much for
watching and hope to see you soon.

317
