2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,170
Today I will provide a brief outlook
on the last two weeks of this course.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,540
In the last four weeks we
have focused on control flow.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,590
First we looked at process discovery.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,860
Finding the ordering of activities.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,500
And we use the metaphor of discovering
a desire line to see what the process of

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,270
discovery is actually all about.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,850
In the last week we focused very
much on conformance checking.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,000
We were comparing modeled and
observed behavior.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,109
Thereby diagnosing
the deviations that took place.

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,430
Replaying an event log on
a control flow model allows us to

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,680
breath life into models that
are otherwise completely static.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,480
You can see a nice example here of
breathing life into a static model.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,720
And for that, event data, is crucial.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:09,220
As we have seen before,
event data contains much more information.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,730
For example,
if you look at the animation next to me,

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,480
this is only possible because we
have timestamps in event logs.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,550
But in event logs we also have
information about resources.

20
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,760
We have information about.

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:31,140
The properties of customers, we have all
kind of other data attributes that we can use.

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,470
In the last two weeks we will focus on
these other perspectives, we will look

23
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,150
at new process mining tasks related
to these additional perspectives and

24
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,710
overall we will focus more on
the practical side of process mining.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,350
Also the nature of this
course will change markedly.

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,160
Lectures will be shorter and
less technical.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,160
And this is done to give you all the time
to do experiments using data and

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,640
the tools that are provided.

29
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,900
Please be aware of the fact that there
are lots and lots of event logs available,

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,000
and there is nothing stopping you from
actually starting analyzing event logs.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,834
As a starting point,
you can go to processmining.org.

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,810
So this slide shows the focus so far.

33
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,620
We have been looking at discovery and
conformance checking.

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,200
For discovery we start from a log and
create a model.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,570
For conformance checking we take a log and
a model.

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,790
And we provide diagnostics and
quantify differences between modeled and

37
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,730
observed behavior.

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,780
In all of these things we have been
focusing on control flow only.

39
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,740
But this is only part of the story.

40
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,800
For example, if you look at this matrix,
you can see the bigger picture.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,480
Next to discovery and conformance
checking we also have enhancement.

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,930
So we take a log and
an initial model and we repair or

43
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,210
enrich the model with
additional information.

44
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,070
For example we can use conformance
checking to change the model in

45
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,220
such a way that it better fit reality.

46
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,630
Or we can exploit the time stamps to
extend the model with stochastic or

47
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,860
performance information.

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,310
To do these things we often
not just look at control flow,

49
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,520
but also include time, resources and data.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,100
And here we often use techniques that,
are adopted from other areas.

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,640
Like data mining, for example we will
talk about decision mining in

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,710
processes and for that we will be using
standard data mining techniques that we

53
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,890
have seen in the first week.

54
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,830
We will analyze resource behavior for

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,720
that, we will look at techniques
related to social network analysis.

56
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,790
We often look at performance of processes.

57
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,180
Thereby we can relate techniques
from operations research like for

58
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,809
example, simulation or queuing
networks to process mining techniques.

59
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,560
So, what are typical topics that we
will talk about in the next two weeks?

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,970
We will talk about mining decision points,
understanding why

61
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,730
certain cases take a particular route,
other cases take another route.

62
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,020
We will mine for bottlenecks.

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,500
Where are the bottlenecks?

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,490
Why are they there?

65
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,670
We will mine social networks.

66
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,290
In general we will focus
on the resource behavior.

67
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,300
For example which people
are working together?

68
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,420
When are people most effective?

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,710
Do people start working faster
if they have more work?

70
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,130
We will also look at comparing processes.

71
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,420
For example,
what is the difference of the process for

72
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,430
gold customer, versus the process for
silver customers?

73
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,860
What are differences between the study
behavior of students that pass and

74
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,930
the study behavior of
students that fail a course?

75
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,880
For this,
we use comparative process mining.

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,610
We will look at operational support.

77
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,240
Everything we have done so
far was done offline.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,260
For operational support, we go to
an online setting where we look at

79
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,260
techniques like detecting that things
go wrong, that there are deviations.

80
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,680
Not after the fact, but at a point in
time when these deviations happen.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,230
We will look at predictions.

82
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,420
For example, what is the remaining
processing time of a particular case?

83
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,340
We will even look at
the recommendations where we

84
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,170
say based on historic information,

85
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,270
and information about
the current state of cases,

86
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,440
we recommend these are the best
activities to be executed.

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,050
Or that these are the best resources
to do a particular activity.

88
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,030
All these things lead to a more refined
process mining framework that will be

89
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,180
explained in detail.

90
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,590
We will also make a link
to other types of analysis.

91
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,010
Earlier I mentioned operations research.

92
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,700
For example,
we can use the discovered process models,

93
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,050
using process mining, to do simulation
experiments to do what if analysis.

94
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,750
We will look at the problem
of data extraction.

95
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,580
How can we convert data into event logs?

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,380
But we will also give guidelines for
logging.

97
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,930
If you are designing a new system, what
should you actually record to be able to

98
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:50,570
do process mining, and to,
to get the best analysis answers possible?

99
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,130
We will also talk about conducting
a process mining project.

100
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,730
What are the phases?

101
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,520
What are the
points that you should be aware of?

102
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,240
In the context of this, we will see
that there is a wide range of processes,

103
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,870
some processes we refer
to lasagna processes.

104
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,110
Structured processes,
where it is not that interesting to

105
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,220
do process discovery because we already
know what the process looks like.

106
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,830
But where we are very interested in
trying to see how we can improve it.

107
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,230
For example, through bottleneck analysis,

108
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,360
through understanding what are the best
resources at a particular point in time.

109
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,840
Well, at the other end of the spectrum
we will find spaghetti processes.

110
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,550
Processes that are very unstructured,

111
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,660
where it makes no sense to try to predict
what is going to happen tomorrow.

112
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,270
You first need to provide insights.

113
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,010
And process discovery itself
is already very valuable.

114
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,150
All of these things are related
to creating a toolbox for

115
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,870
the data scientist or
the process scientist of the future.

116
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,610
People need these types of instruments
to do analysis that really matters,

117
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,519
and that really helps organizations
to improve systems and processes.

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,360
As mentioned before,
the next two weeks will be very different.

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,020
They will be less technical.

120
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,090
The lectures will be shorter.

121
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,350
It will have a more applied flavor.

122
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,240
One of the reasons for having shorter
lectures is that we would like to

123
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,715
provide opportunities to actually use the,
the software.

124
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:38,440
Prom/Disco, and the data set, to get hands
on experience with the process mining.

125
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,180
Also, try to think beyond
the data sets that are provided.

126
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,310
If you go to processmining.org,
you can find many,

127
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,239
many data sets that you can use.

128
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,560
You can also look at,
process mining data used for competitions.

129
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,190
For example, the BPI challenges, where
you can apply process mining to real,

130
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,480
live, event logs.

131
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,890
You can also look at the many data
sets that are publicly available for

132
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,340
data mining.

133
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:17,010
Many of these data sets, one can see that
in some way, events are being described.

134
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,370
So you could convert them to event logs.

135
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,370
There is a, a large movement taking place
at this point in time, to make data open.

136
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,230
Many governments.

137
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,940
Are forced or
really want to provide data to the,

138
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,440
citizens, and that is creating new
possibilities for process mining.

139
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,840
Also, you can look at social media.

140
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,720
If you look at Twitter, Facebook, and
Google, they all provide open APIs.

141
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,730
So they allow you to extract event logs
from things that you find interesting.

142
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,870
These are the chapters that will be
covered in the next, couple of lectures.

143
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:07,103
And as I said before, the focus will now
be more on the practical side of things.

144
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,070
Thank you for watching this lecture.

145
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,453
Hope to see you soon.
