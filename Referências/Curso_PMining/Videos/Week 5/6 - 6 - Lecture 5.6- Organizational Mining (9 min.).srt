2
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:11,830
Welcome to this lecture of the course on
Process Mining: Data Science in Action.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,470
Today we will focus on learning
organizational entities.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,080
Using the resource activity matrix,
we can automatically learn roles and

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,610
extend the process model
with this information.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,690
In the previous lecture,
we learned how to create a social network

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,560
by extracting information
from the event log.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,700
We saw that it is possible to discover
relationships between people.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,150
When do people work together?

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,150
How is work handed over from
one person to another person?

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,070
In this lecture, we will look at
analyzing event logs to automatically

12
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,190
infer role information and
add that to the process model.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,856
In the last lecture we saw how to create
a so-called resource-activity matrix.

14
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:10,020
So we extract events and
we simply count the number of times

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,100
that a resource is executing a particular
activity and we normalize that per case.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,930
So for example, Pete, on average,
executed a 0.3 times.

17
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,320
If we look at such a matrix, then the
question is, which resources are similar?

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,926
So please take a look at this example, and

19
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:35,658
try to discover yourself,
what are the underlying roles?

20
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:41,607
The answer to this
question is very simple.

21
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:46,697
In this particular example it is
very clear that Pete, Mike and

22
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:51,883
Ellen are very similar in terms of
the set of activities that they

23
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:57,960
are executing and how frequent they
are executing these activities.

24
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:04,580
Sue and Sean are the only people,
for example, executing activity b.

25
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,390
Sara is the only person executing e and f.

26
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,150
And so here it very clear.

27
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,480
But in general it is not that clear.

28
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,580
We can view every resource as a vector,

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,060
describing how often each
activity is executed per case.

30
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,400
And here you see, for example, the vectors
corresponding to Pete, Mike and Sara.

31
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,680
We can compute distances on these
vectors using classical notions like

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,610
the Euclidian distance,
Manhattan distance and all kinds of other

33
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,870
measures of deciding how far
apart different resources are.

34
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,550
And this information can be
used to infer a social network.

35
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,840
And in this social network,
we expect Pete and

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,480
Mike to be very close to each other
because their distances are very small.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,993
Sara, on the other hand,
is quite different in terms of

38
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:05,330
the activities that she's executing,
than Pete and Mike.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,600
So if we create a social network
based on this information,

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,269
we would get something like this.

41
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,600
Note that similarity is
the inverse of distance.

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,180
And so people that are at a short
distance are very similar so

43
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,280
are strongly related
in the social network.

44
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,880
Resources that execute similar
collections of activities are related.

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,440
For example,
here we can see that Sara is quite unique,

46
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,100
that is why she is not connected
to any of the other resources.

47
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,880
Note that we have removed
all the self-loops because,

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,270
of course,
every resource is very similar to itself.

49
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,630
And so that's why you don't
see any self-loops here.

50
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,230
Looking at similarity between
different resources to

51
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,800
identify roles in a process model
is very much related to clustering.

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,750
And in the first week we saw
techniques like k-means clustering.

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,570
How we can group things together
based on the vector representation.

54
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,110
So we can use that in
the context of process mining.

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,180
There are two typical uses.

56
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,510
One use is that we would like to
group cases which are very similar.

57
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,930
And then, per group of similar cases,
we can infer a process model.

58
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,950
So, if in this diagram all
the dots correspond to cases,

59
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,210
then we would find four groups of cases,

60
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,555
in other words we would find four
variants of the same process.

61
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:46,860
And the process model for each of
these variants is simpler than if we

62
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,270
would try to construct one overall
model for all the different groups.

63
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,000
In this lecture,
we focus on the grouping of resources.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
So now all the dots are resources.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,580
We look at their distances and
try to group them together.

66
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,790
Once we find a group of resources
we can attach a role to it and

67
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,720
use this to extend,
to enrich the process model.

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,570
Here you see a real-life examples.

69
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,730
The numbers that you see indicate how

70
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,660
frequent a particular user is
executing a particular activity.

71
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,930
This is taken from real life data.

72
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,310
And in this example you can see that
it is quite easy to find cliques,

73
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,090
clusters of people that
have a very similar

74
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,770
profile when we look at which activities
are being executed and how frequent.

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,780
So this result was obtained by ProM.

76
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,810
So using ProM, we can infer,
automatically roles.

77
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,750
Then the question is, if we have
identified these groups, these sets of

78
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,850
people having a similar work profile,
how can we add that to the model?

79
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,920
Well, that is very simple.

80
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,392
In the model we can simply
associate activities to roles.

81
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:19,743
So in this example we have three roles,
manager,

82
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:26,100
expert and the other three resources.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,720
And we can relate these roles
to the process model and

84
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,660
we can relate the roles to
the individual worker in this case.

85
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,866
This view is a bit simplified because,
of course, roles can overlap.

86
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:48,850
One person may be able to
perform multiple roles and then this

87
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,260
picture will become a bit more involved,
but the basic idea is very simple.

88
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,650
Learning role information
is just a starting point.

89
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,890
And so we may be interested
in very different questions, but

90
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,950
also related to the behavior of
resources in the context of a process.

91
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,480
So when are resources available?

92
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,790
Do they work at particular
times during the week?

93
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,240
Are they shared among different processes?

94
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,820
When do resources collaborate well?

95
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:27,510
Are certain resources better to perform
specific activities than others?

96
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,240
We would like to learn such information
from event logs, and we can.

97
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,790
For example, a rather specific question
is investigating the relationship

98
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,862
between the work load of people and
how efficient, how fast they work.

99
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:52,500
And the so-called Yerkes-Dodson law
of arousal predicts that if people

100
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,910
get more work, that they start working
more efficient until a certain point,

101
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,970
after which performance will break down,
as you can see in this diagram.

102
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,710
If you are applying process
mining on real-life logs,

103
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,000
you are able to see these phenomena,
and you can learn from them.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,310
They will tell you how to better run
a particular process or company.

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,580
So we need process models that
incorporate different perspectives.

106
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,120
In this lecture we focused on the
relationship between people and processes.

107
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,710
People have roles, are
member of particular departments and

108
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,520
we need to look at the relationship
between these two.

109
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,198
If you would like to
learn more about this,

110
00:08:39,198 --> 00:08:41,447
you can read all about it in chapter 8.

111
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,247
Thank you for watching this lecture.

112
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:44,436
See you next time.
