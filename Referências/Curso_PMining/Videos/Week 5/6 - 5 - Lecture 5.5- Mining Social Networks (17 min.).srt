2
00:00:07,192 --> 00:00:08,940
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,630
After enriching models with time and

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,430
data related aspects we now focus
on the resource perspective.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,150
We will learn to create resource
activity and hand over work matrices.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,320
Moreover we will see that social
networks can be created from event data.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,780
Events that we see in event logs,

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,320
they often capture human behavior and that
makes their analysis very interesting.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,920
Humans leave all kinds of
trails in all kinds of systems.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,280
The first week,
we spoke about the Internet of events.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,860
One can look at what people are doing
socially, on Facebook or Twitter.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,070
One can look at work-related systems.

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,410
And in the future, more and more devices
will be connected to the Internet, and

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,690
will collect data about human behavior.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:13,300
So in this lecture, we will focus on
analyzing the social aspect of event logs.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,430
And we will look at things
like social networks.

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,740
So, what is the input for such analysis?

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,480
We have event logs and these event
logs may refer to the actual people,

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,770
the actual actors, executing
the activities, as you can see here.

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,110
So events have a resource attribute, and

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,250
using these resource attributes,
we can do very simple forms of analysis.

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,060
For example if you look at this so-called
resource-activity matrix, we can see

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,190
how many times a resource is
executing particular activities.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,660
So if you look at this particular example
extracted from the event log that we

25
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,516
have seen before,
we can see that activity a is

26
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:12,960
executed on average exactly once.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,210
And we can see that by adding up
the numbers in this particular column.

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,020
What we can also see is that Pete,
Mike, and

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,048
Ellen are the only ones
executing this activity.

30
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:30,070
So in 30% of the cases,
a is being executed by Pete.

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,640
In 50% of the cases,
a is being executed by Mike, and

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,150
in the remaining 20% it
is executed by Ellen.

33
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,350
So we can read such information
from the resource activity metrics.

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,810
What we can also see is that Sara is
the only person able to execute activities

35
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,390
e and f based on the evidence that
we have seen in the event log.

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,408
On average, 2.3 times per case
activity e is executed by Sara.

37
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:07,910
So the resource-activity matrix

38
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,120
provides basic insights into who
is doing what in the event log.

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,850
But the information is very basic.

40
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
Let's take a look at this event log and

41
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,660
also try to create
a resource activity matrix.

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,780
So again in this log we see that Pete
starts by executing activity a for

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,720
case 1 at time 10.

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,040
If we look at the end of this
event log we can see that Carol

45
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,340
executes activity f for case 2.

46
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,390
Here we can see all the information.

47
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,190
So we can see the process model and
we can see the event log.

48
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,840
And now try to create a resource
activity matrix yourself.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,880
This may take some time.

50
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,200
So the answer is shown here.

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,450
Based on the event log we can extract
this resource activity matrix.

52
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:10,250
So, what we can see is that Pete
is the only one able to execute a.

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,780
And for example, Carol is the only one
able to execute f, and on average,

54
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,060
this is done once per case.

55
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,170
The matrix that we just shown
is not really showing any

56
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,120
relationships between people.

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,710
For that we need to
create a social network.

58
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,483
So how does that work?

59
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:35,680
Let's first start by looking
at a real-life example.

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,379
So this is the social network of
the so-called Al-Qaeda network

61
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,080
after the 9/11 disaster.

62
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:51,079
So this social network was created
by analyzing newspaper articles.

63
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,970
Social network analysis, creating these
types of graphs is already very old.

64
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:05,010
Already in the 1930s Moreno
created such networks.

65
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,160
We can view them as a graph
with thicker and thinner lines

66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,290
indicating the relationships, or
we can look at them in matrix form.

67
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,070
The nodes in such a diagram
that correspond to people or

68
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,310
groups of people or departments,
the arcs they indicate relationships

69
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,790
they have weights or
inverted notion of distance.

70
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,390
So what you can see in this social network
is that the strongest relationships

71
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,710
are indicated using thick lines.

72
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,940
We can also compute metrics over
such social networks to see

73
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,830
which are the people that
are most central in this network.

74
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,160
We can also identify cliques of people,
people that have many relationships among

75
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,170
them as a group, but with fewer
connections to the rest of the network.

76
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,030
So this the notation that we will use.

77
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,860
So the ovals correspond to
organizational entities.

78
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:19,520
These can be individual resources, people,
roles, but also things like departments.

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,250
The arcs correspond to relationships.

80
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,500
The thickness of an arc indicates how
strong this relationship is and

81
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,700
we can also vary the size
of the ovals to indicate

82
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,359
how frequent the entity is
executing particular activities.

83
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,280
There are many ways to measure
the importance of a node.

84
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,790
For example,
a person in such a social network.

85
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,660
There is the notion of degree centrality.

86
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,150
This simply counts,
if you look at the node,

87
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:03,080
how many arcs it has to other nodes,
so it's a very localized notion.

88
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,900
So, the things that are highlighted in red

89
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,950
indicate the nodes that have
the highest degree of centrality.

90
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,390
If you look at the diagram in the middle,
we can see closeness centrality.

91
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,150
So now the nodes in red
are most important.

92
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,730
Not because they have many direct
neighbors, but it is based on

93
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,750
one divided by the sum of all shorter
paths to this particular node.

94
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,300
So the things that are most
central are indicated in red.

95
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,970
A related notion is
betweenness centrality.

96
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,100
Now we count the fraction of
shortest paths between any two

97
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,530
nodes going through the nodes that
we are trying to analyze.

98
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,980
So you can see depending on
the notion that you choose

99
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,510
different entities will become central
in the network that we are considering.

100
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,850
This is a topic in itself.

101
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,190
There are many of such 
definitions, and

102
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,320
it's a bit outside
the scope of this course.

103
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,100
However, based on event logs we can
create such networks and

104
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,230
apply standard techniques to analyze them.

105
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,730
So, based on an event log,
how can we create such a social network?

106
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,250
Well, this is done using
the handover of work matrix.

107
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,370
This is a matrix where we show,

108
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,050
how frequently work is handed over
from one person, to another person.

109
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,380
So to be more precise,
we count the number of times work is

110
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,790
handed over from one resource to
another resource on average per case.

111
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,310
So based on the event log
that we have seen earlier

112
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,040
we construct this handover of work
matrix where Pete is handing over

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,949
work to himself on average
0.135 times per case.

114
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:12,570
If we look at Sara and Mike,
their relationship, for

115
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,359
example Sara is handing over work to
Mike on the average 1.4 times per case.

116
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,320
So the higher these numbers,

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,100
the more frequently work is passed on
from one person to another person.

118
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,530
When we do this analysis,

119
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,300
we should of course take into
account the underlying process.

120
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:42,340
So if things are concurrent,
then we should not count handovers

121
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,550
between concurrent activities, because
they do not causally depend on each other.

122
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,090
So while creating this matrix we take
into account the control flow structure.

123
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,850
So based on this matrix,
we can create a graph where we

124
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,580
leave out the arcs which have
a weight that is too low.

125
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,190
So for example, if we look at the matrix,

126
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,020
we can see that there is
a relationship between Ellen and Pete.

127
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,430
But it is too weak to
be shown in this graph,

128
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,790
because we chose the threshold of 0.1.

129
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,870
So this is the social network based
on the handover of work matrix.

130
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,590
In this picture,

131
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:33,490
the thickness of the arc relates to
the number in the handover of work matrix.

132
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,230
All the ovals have the same size.

133
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,590
We are not using the feature that
we can make the size depending on

134
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,390
the frequency with which people
have executed activities for cases.

135
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,160
This diagram is at the level
of individual resources.

136
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,610
We can also create diagrams that
look at roles or departments.

137
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,970
In fact, if we look at an information
system of a typical organization,

138
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,470
there are lots of information
relating people to departments or

139
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,740
to particular roles in the organization.

140
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,500
In more advanced information
systems even the event log

141
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,190
itself has information about the role or

142
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,420
the department that people have when
they are executing a particular event.

143
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,970
In our small example, we are now
assuming that there are three roles,

144
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,080
the role of Assistant, the role of
Expert and the role of Manager.

145
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,470
For example Sara is the only person
that can play the role of Manager,

146
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,260
while we have three assistants,
Pete, Mike and, Ellen.

147
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,850
So if we have grouping of
resources in this way,

148
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,500
we can also create social networks
at the higher level of abstraction.

149
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,390
So now you can see the social
network relating assistance to

150
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,820
managers to experts.

151
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,170
And so, in this picture,
again the arcs show how frequent, for

152
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,830
example work is handed over
from a manager to an assistant.

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,830
But what we can also see is
that the size of the oval is

154
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,930
indicating how much work is done by
people having a particular role.

155
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,800
So this gives insights at the desired
level of abstraction that we

156
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,770
would like to use.

157
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,150
ProM supports the construction of such
social networks in many different ways.

158
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,260
So, here we see some examples.

159
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,310
So first of all there is a plug-in
that creates a social network based on

160
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,720
the handover of work.

161
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,540
This is exactly what we have seen before.

162
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,740
However, there are many other ways that we

163
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,670
can build a social network
based on event data.

164
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,780
One example is that we can consider
people to be close, to have a strong

165
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,770
relationship, if they typically execute
the same collection of activities.

166
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:12,180
And so people doing the same types of
things, are considered to be close.

167
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,080
People doing very different
things are considered to

168
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,010
be very far apart from each other.

169
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,540
We can do this at the level of activities.

170
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,540
We can also do this at the level of cases.

171
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,760
So people that often work together on
the same cases are considered to be close.

172
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,330
People never working together on the same
case are considered to be more distant.

173
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,160
So using these distance notions
we can create social networks.

174
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,590
And for example here you see a social
network based on the handover of

175
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,630
work metric, as we have seen before.

176
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,110
So the coloring can be
used to identify cliques.

177
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,570
We can remove arcs that are infrequent.

178
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,240
We can influence the size of the bubbles
based on particular characteristics so

179
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,510
it's a very flexible tool.

180
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,531
If we look at problem we can also analyze
resource behavior, social behavior,

181
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:18,540
by creatively replacing activity
names by resource names.

182
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,420
And some of the plugins
actually have a feature for

183
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,300
this, to do this automatically.

184
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,380
So for example,
if you look at inductive minor,

185
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,070
what you see here is the discovered
control flow process.

186
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,620
So now the nodes are activities,
but you can change the view and

187
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:42,430
create a model where the nodes correspond
not to activities but to people.

188
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,205
Now we see a different type of process and

189
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:51,190
it is showing how work is flowing
from one person to another person.

190
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,370
So in a way you can think of this, as a
kind of social network, but on top of it,

191
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,290
because it's like a process,
we can animate things over it.

192
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,590
So in summary, what we have seen is that
we can create a resource activity matrix,

193
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,220
showing who is doing what,
very basic information.

194
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,470
We can create a handover of
work matrix showing how work is

195
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,550
being transferred from one
person to another person.

196
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,500
And this can be used to
create a social network.

197
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,100
But the handover of work matrix is
just one of many possibilities that we

198
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,790
can use to create such a social network.

199
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,900
Event logs provide lots of information
that can be used to create

200
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,620
different views on the social
behavior inside work processes.

201
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,060
Once we have such a social network,
it can be analyzed in many different ways.

202
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,930
We can compute which
are the most central people,

203
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,200
what are cliques of people often
working together, etcetera.

204
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,089
So it is very important that
one is aware that one can

205
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:09,498
analyze the human behavior in these
processes that we are analyzing,

206
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:14,732
and this often provides clues
on how to do things better.

207
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:19,547
To read more about this,
please take a look at chapter 8.

208
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:22,382
Thank you for watching,
and hope to see you soon.
