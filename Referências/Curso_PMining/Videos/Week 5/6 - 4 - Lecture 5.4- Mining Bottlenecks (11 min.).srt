2
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,931
Glad to see you again.

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:13,166
In the last two lectures we showed
that decision tree analysis can be

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,940
used to enrich discovered process models.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,870
We now use the timestamps in the

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,889
event logs to analyze performance and
suggest improvements.

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,750
If we have processes that
have no problems in them,

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,540
where everything is running smooth,
there are no bottlenecks,

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,440
then process mining may not
have a very large added value.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,650
However, if you have processes like this
that have huge performance problems,

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,730
then process mining can be extremely
valuable because there're many ways in

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,780
which analyzing the process
may help to improve it.

13
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,080
In this lecture we will focus
on bottleneck analysis,

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,250
using the timestamps
that are present in logs.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,580
We would like to find out where are the
bottlenecks, and why are they there.

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,570
To do this, we are using event logs.

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,350
Where events have timestamps.

18
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,580
But often, also transactional information.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,989
Like start and complete.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,250
For example, for case one activity,
a started at time 12 and ended at time 19.

21
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,450
And the same we can see for all the other
events for this particular case.

22
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,969
So this is the input that we would
like to use for performance analysis.

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,980
We can look at basic performance
information, like, for

24
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,480
example, the duration of cases.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,410
When we look at such data we can see
when things start and when things end.

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,350
But you can do this with any BI tool.

27
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,410
What makes process mining different,

28
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,518
is that you can look inside the process,
other than just looking at

29
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:05,150
spreadsheet-like information that
you see in many of the BI tools.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:13,000
So we would like to understand the more
detailed timed behavior of a process.

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,480
So this slide shows a lot of

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
information related to
the execution of just three cases.

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,380
So it is showing durations,
waiting times, and

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,030
all kinds of other things
that we can measure.

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,690
If we replay these three
cases on this process model.

36
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,580
Let's zoom in to some of the parts.

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,440
For example we can see that
case one started at time 12.

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,390
Then for case one,
activity a was being executed, and

39
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,560
that started at time 12 and
ended at time 19.

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,600
So we know that the duration of this
particular instance of activity a for

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,050
case one was seven time units.

42
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,330
We can also look at the time in
between a and b, the waiting time.

43
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,490
That is equivalent to six for
this particular instance.

44
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,180
If we look at the bottom part,

45
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,560
then we can see that through f,
one case was looping back.

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,620
Case number three.

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,610
So we can find two activity instances.

48
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,760
For activity d, for case three.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,317
We can also see multiple
waiting times related to

50
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:38,874
this extra iteration of this case three.

51
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:44,180
We can also look at the end, and there
we can see the completion time of cases.

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,810
So this is the detailed information that
we can get by replaying the event log,

53
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,590
after alignment,
on top of the process model.

54
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,130
We can also take another view.

55
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,410
More like a Gantt chart
overview of the event log.

56
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,750
So in this diagram, we see for
every case what are the activities that

57
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,260
are being executed, and
what are the waiting times.

58
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,630
The black bars correspond to

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,770
the actual processing of an activity
instance, for a particular case.

60
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,820
The grey parts correspond
to waiting times.

61
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,050
So an activity instance is enabled,
but was not yet started.

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,970
If we look at case three, we can for

63
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,960
example see the interval of activity a for
case three.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,090
And we can see that after a completed,
that the waiting time for c and d started.

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,250
And then after c and
d the waiting for e started.

66
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:01,060
Note that the waiting for e only starts
after d and c have both completed.

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,770
So this visualizes from a case
perspective, what has happened.

68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,090
We can also take a resource perspective.

69
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,370
It's exactly the same, but
now along the y-axis, we see people.

70
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,370
So we can see what they are doing,
and when cases were waiting for

71
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,570
them to start executing
particular activity instances.

72
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,020
We can also mix these
two views using colors.

73
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,740
So now the red color for example refers
to activity instances of case one.

74
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,520
What you can see in this diagram,
that because of the extra loop,

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,940
the iteration of case three,
there are more activities for

76
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,469
case three than for
the other two activities.

77
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,540
So, after providing such a Gantt chart,
and the details replay of

78
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,100
the event log on top of the process model,
we can collect all kinds of statistics.

79
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,070
So we can see the waiting
times in between activities.

80
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,580
We can see the mean time, we can see
variations, and things like that.

81
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,690
We can also look at the service times.

82
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,540
So, if we have start and complete events,
we can measure how long activities take,

83
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,579
and we can again compute the average and
standard deviation over these times.

84
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,770
We can also compute routing probabilities.

85
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,900
So for example, in this particular
example, there was a 50:50

86
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,360
probability of choosing b over c.

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,880
And so both have an equal probability.

88
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,480
The choice after e.

89
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,670
You can see that a branch to
g has a probability of 0.5.

90
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:56,311
The other two branches have
a probability of 0.25.

91
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:58,020
So we can also learn this.

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,250
Let's take a look at another event
log to see another example of

93
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,100
this detailed replay and
corresponding performance.

94
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,670
Metrics that we can compute.

95
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,870
So if we take a look at this log,
then Pete started by

96
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,430
executing activity a at time ten,
and ended at time 12.

97
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,160
Then we can again take at a look
at the whole event log as a ref,

98
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,250
again referring to just very few cases.

99
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:33,782
For example, this event log ends
with Carol starting activity f for

100
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:40,010
case two at time 57 and
ending this activity instance at time 60.

101
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:46,219
So again we can take this, we can take the
event log, we can take the process model,

102
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:52,989
and we can again try to estimate service
times waiting times routing probabilities.

103
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,650
If we do this,
then we first do the detailed replay.

104
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,170
So these are the detailed
statistics that we can gather.

105
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,470
Note in this example that there
are two silent activities.

106
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,830
The end split before b and c,
and the end join after b and c.

107
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,420
We cannot see them in the log, but
through alignments we know when they

108
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,150
are being executed and
how to align them properly with the model.

109
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,960
So again, we can collect
statistics about waiting times.

110
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,570
We can look at the average, we can,
you can look at the standard deviation.

111
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,180
We can look at service times as you
can see here.

112
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,680
So we can collect all kinds of statistics
including routing probabilities.

113
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,230
So these are the things that
we can get from event logs.

114
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,620
When I tell this, I hope that you can
see that you have actually seen and

115
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,720
used this before.

116
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,430
When you are using tools like Disco.

117
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,320
They are replaying the event
log on top of the model,

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,460
to indicate what are the parts
where the biggest bottlenecks are.

119
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,860
So for example here, fix arcs

120
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,929
colored in red correspond to the main
bottlenecks in this particular process.

121
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,180
We've also seen this in
the context of ProM.

122
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,130
And so we can let things highlight in red

123
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,160
the moment that there is
a performance problem.

124
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,640
And so we have used these things before,
but now we

125
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,130
can see how these timestamps are actually
being used at a more detailed level.

126
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,600
Using process mining, we can
automatically discover process models.

127
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,190
We have seen that.

128
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,180
When we discuss conformance
checking we have shown

129
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,080
that you can relate an event log and
a model through the notion of alignment.

130
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,800
So even if the real process
deviates a bit from the model,

131
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,470
you can still relate real
behavior to a process model.

132
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,260
Once you have these alignments,
you can do a replay of the entire log.

133
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,610
And by doing that and
inspecting the timestamps you can identify

134
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,419
bottlenecks and measure all kinds of
other performance related things.

135
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,800
The result of all of
this is a process model

136
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,820
extended with performance information.

137
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,380
And such a process model can
be the starting point for

138
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,030
all kinds of process improvement and
operational support.

139
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,310
In one of the future lectures for example,
we will focus on predictions, and

140
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,920
these predictions are using exactly the
types of statistics that I showed today,

141
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,190
that you can collect from event logs.

142
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,620
In chapter eight, we are relating
timestamps to process models, and

143
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,560
you can read more about how to extend
models with this extra perspective.

144
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,590
Thank you for watching this lecture.

145
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,511
See you next time.
