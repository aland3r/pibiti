[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,000
Glad to see you again.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,550
Until now,
we have been focusing on one process at

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,820
a time without comparing process variants,
organizations, or groups of cases.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,110
Today we introduce process
cubes as a means to

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,690
support more systematic forms
of comparative process mining.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,570
I'm sure that as a child
you have played this game.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,400
You will compare two pictures and you need
to find the ten differences between them.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,630
For example, you can see that
the cookie on one side is half eaten,

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,210
whereas on the other side, it is not.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,960
If you are interested in comparing
different departments in a hospital.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,700
If you are interested
in comparing different

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,780
locations of a car rental agency.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,280
You would like to compare
different processes.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,660
If you put these process
models on top of each other,

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,930
you can see where the differences are.

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,100
But if you look at processes,
it is not that simple.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,700
We would like to find what
are differences in performance,

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,610
what are differences in conformance,
and how can they be explained.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,750
To do this in a systematic manner
we use so called process cubes.

21
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,490
So, process cubes contain all event
data in a particular situation,

22
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,400
but the event data is organized
along a number of dimensions.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,180
For example, time, department, in which
department does the event take place.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,180
At which location.

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,760
What is the amount involved in
the case the event belongs to?

26
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,520
What is the gender of the student
studying a particular course?

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,280
What is the priority of a customer order?

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,220
Is the case compliant, or not?

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,810
All of these characteristics of events and

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,100
cases can be used to build
a multi-dimensional cube.

31
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,320
This cube helps us to compare event data
and processes along different dimensions,

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,780
in order to compare
different process variance,

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,990
different departments,
different types of customers.

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,350
So let's take a step back.

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,778
If we take a classical
data mining problem,

36
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:29,790
we start with data that looks like this.

37
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,040
And so we have a table
consisting of different rows.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,450
The rows correspond to instances.

39
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,730
The columns correspond to variables.

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,660
We can look at predictor variables.

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,820
And if we do supervised learning, we
also need to select a response variable.

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,990
And given the same set of data,

43
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,250
we can one time select one
variable as a response variable.

44
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,650
For other types of analysis,

45
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,380
we will select another variable
as a response variable.

46
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,340
In the case of process mining,
it is very similar.

47
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,390
Again, we have input, but
now the input are events.

48
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,540
And events have very specific
characteristics different from

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,280
the input that we take for
a general data mining problem.

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,720
We need to select one of these columns,

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,500
one of these attributes,
as representing the case.

52
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,540
But that's not all,
we need to decide what is the activity.

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,750
We need to decide what
is the time attribute,

54
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,270
because we need to be able to
order events within a case.

55
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,580
We can also have optional attributes
like the resource executing

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,050
the corresponding activity.

57
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,510
There may be transactional information,
start and complete.

58
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,220
And there may be all kinds of other
attributes associated with an event or

59
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,480
the corresponding case.

60
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,420
So we have multiple dimensions,
and given one set of data,

61
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:08,710
we can do this type of mapping onto
process minings concepts multiple times.

62
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,960
For example, if you load a CSV file,
so a comma separated value file,

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,150
into Disco, when loading, you need
to decide what all the columns mean.

64
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,680
What is the column that
represents the case ID?

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,810
What is the column that
represents activity?

66
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,120
Multiple mappings are possible.

67
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,430
Depending on the type of analysis
that you would like to do,

68
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,278
you choose a different mapping.

69
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:42,420
Also, you often filter event
data in such a way that

70
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,510
you are able to compare different groups
of cases, or different group of events.

71
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,670
In a process cube, you try to do this
in a more systematic manner rather than

72
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,820
making ad hoc decisions
whenever we reload event data.

73
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:04,920
So if we group events in a so called
process cube then it will look like this.

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,680
So, this is a cube consisting
of three dimensions.

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,770
In general, if we look at process cubes,

76
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,710
we may have dozens of
different dimensions.

77
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,610
If you look at the car
rental agency like Hertz,

78
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,520
it has thousands of offices
all over the world.

79
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,080
Offices in Amsterdam, offices in Eindhoven,
offices in Paris, and

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,460
all kinds of other locations.

81
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,060
We have different types of customers.

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,210
There are gold customers,
silver customers, normal customers.

83
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,770
Also we can look at the process
at different points in time.

84
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,880
So we can look at
the events in January and

85
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,260
compare these events
with events in February.

86
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,160
And for each of the cells in
this multi-dimensional cube,

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,710
we can automatically construct
models using the techniques that we

88
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,200
have seen in earlier lectures.

89
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,230
And then it becomes very
interesting to compare these.

90
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,950
Did the process change,
moving from January to February?

91
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,340
Is the process for gold customers
different than the process for

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,150
silver customers?

93
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,310
Does the location in Amsterdam work
different than the location in Eindhoven.

94
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,639
Using comparative process mining,
you can answer such questions.

95
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,620
Let's take a look at another example.

96
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,800
In the Netherlands,

97
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,200
there are approximately 400
different municipalities, and

98
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,850
in each of these municipalities,
you can request a building permit.

99
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,660
Building permits may relate to very

100
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,540
large construction activities or
very small construction activities.

101
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,030
There are different municipalities.

102
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,430
There are also different periods.

103
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,940
And again, it is very interesting
to compare the process within one

104
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,050
municipality and
compare that to another one.

105
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,010
And to see what
are the typical differences.

106
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,060
Also we would like to
see changes over time.

107
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,730
This is often referred
to as concept drift.

108
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,970
You would like to understand
why did the process change at

109
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,180
a particular point in time.

110
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,640
Last example of a process cube.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,300
Here, we look at student data.

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,370
Students are studying,
they generate all kinds of events.

113
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,050
For example, they make assignments,
they may make homework.

114
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,300
They take a final exam.

115
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,970
They may have different overall marks,

116
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,330
here from one to ten.

117
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,250
We can compare students that
studied the course in 2012 with

118
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,020
students that study a course in 2013.

119
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,579
And again it is very interesting to
compare all of these different processes.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,730
So the basic idea of a process
cube is very simple.

121
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,710
We have this multi-dimensional data and
using slicing and dicing, drilling down,

122
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:08,750
drilling up, we can select, cells, and
these cells will correspond to events.

123
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,770
We can materialize these cells,
in other words,

124
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,530
we convert them to an ordinary event log,
and then we can do all kinds of analysis.

125
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,780
So we can do this for every cell,
we can focus on particular dimensions,

126
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,230
we can split cells,
we can group cells together.

127
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,340
So this is a very flexible way of
interacting with the event data.

128
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,670
At any point in time we can take
an array of cells and compare them.

129
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,140
We can look at the process models.

130
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,670
We can look at the dotted charts.

131
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,060
Let's take a look at a concrete example.

132
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,980
So, what you see here is a dotted chart

133
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,780
of students studying a particular
course in Eindhoven.

134
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,990
What you see is that every
row corresponds to a student.

135
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,760
Every dot corresponds to
some action of the student.

136
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,140
And you should know that in this course
students can watch video lectures.

137
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,010
So it is expected that students
over time will look at

138
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,210
lectures where whenever they
are ready to study a particular week.

139
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,960
The red dots in this diagram
correspond to exams.

140
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,789
So you can see that they
form straight lines.

141
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,390
These are the points in time
where students can take an exam.

142
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,390
You can see that,
often students fail an exam and

143
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,940
have to redo it at a later point in time.

144
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,450
Let's now zoom in into a particular
instance of this course running in 2011.

145
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,600
So we now zoom in into this data.

146
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,110
And when we zoom into this data,
we could compare the process, for

147
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,810
example, for
male students versus female students.

148
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,040
We could also look at
the study behavior and

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,159
try to compare the difference between
Dutch students and foreign students.

150
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,780
We can also compare the difference
between the behavior of students that

151
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,370
in the end pass the course, and the
students that in the end fail the course.

152
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,900
So if we take the last example, we can

153
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,190
automatically generate a process model for
the students that have passed, and

154
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,060
we can automatically generate a process
model for the students that have failed.

155
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,050
What you can see in this d,

156
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,900
this diagram is that these
processes look very different.

157
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,030
It's not important that you can
read the labels, but let me, for

158
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,620
example, explain one of
the characteristic differences.

159
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,430
So the students that pass, they typically,

160
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,140
the first event is typically
follow the lecture of week one.

161
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,560
If you look at the students that fail,

162
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,350
then the typical first activity
that they execute is make the exam.

163
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,580
So, before watching any of the lectures,
they try to make the exam and then fail.

164
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,880
We can also do conformance
checking of these two

165
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,890
sets of students with respect
to an ideal study model,

166
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,360
that would describe the ideal behavior
of a student following such a course.

167
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,130
What you then see is that
the conformance level of students that

168
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,370
are passing is much higher than

169
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,910
the conformance level of the students
that in the end fail the course.

170
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,530
So this is a nice illustration of
comparative process mining, and

171
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,180
you can quickly get to these types of
results by using the process cube notion.

172
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,160
So, using process cubes, we are able to
play with multi-dimensional event data.

173
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,980
And for people that have
a background in data warehouses or

174
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,840
in OLAP technologies, they will see
that certain things are very similar.

175
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,370
However, there is one
important difference.

176
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,800
If you look at data warehouses and
OLAP type of technologies.

177
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,630
Typically, the goal is to aggregate
things as fast as possible,

178
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,230
to come to clear-cut results.

179
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,690
This typically jeopardizes doing
process mining because the actual

180
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,620
events are being lost.

181
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,600
So if you use a process cube,

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,950
you're typically using data which is
at a lower level, let's say more raw,

183
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,230
than the typical information that
you will find in a data warehouse.

184
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:41,840
So we have been looking at event data
using a multidimensional process cube.

185
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,940
And we do this to be able to compare
different groups of customers,

186
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,540
different groups of patients,
different offices of the same company.

187
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,430
And this provides very
valuable information.

188
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,230
If would like
to learn more about this,

189
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,740
you will not find much about
process cubes in the book.

190
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,478
But you can read this article
that you see on the slide to

191
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:14,099
get more information about this approach
to look at comparative process mining.

192
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:15,957
Thank you for watching this lecture.

193
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,775
See you next time.
