00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:09,650
Welcome to this lecture.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,980
Process mining extends far beyond
discovering control-flow models.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,070
In recent lectures, we have seen that
we can mine different perspectives.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,039
Today we will see that these perspectives
can be combined into more complete models.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,730
Here you see a picture of an elephant,
but you see several people that

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,460
are blindfolded and they just see or
are able to touch part of the elephant.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,790
So, the person that touches
the trunk may think it's a snake.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,060
The person that touches the body
may think that it is a wall.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,210
The person that is touching one
of the four feet may think it's

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,100
a tree, etcetera.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,120
This is the same problem that we have
if we try to do process mining, and

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,610
we look at one perspective in isolation.

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,190
So if you look at process models,

15
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,400
it is not just control-flow, it is also
about data, it is also about time,

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,990
it's about resources,
it's about costs, it's about risk.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,140
We need to combine all of these
different perspectives in a single model

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,860
to be able to really apply process
mining in a meaningful way.

19
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,550
So a process model is composed
of different perspectives and

20
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,260
what is always the backbone
is the control-flow.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,750
So things are attached to the control-flow
and in that way they are related.

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,920
So activities in the control-flow, for
example, they are executed by particular

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,950
resources and take particular amounts of
time, and may have a particular guard.

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,460
So the control-flow is binding
all these things together.

25
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,850
This is a figure that we have seen before.

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,685
What we have seen earlier was that in
the beginning we focused very much on

27
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:07,290
control-flow and
just discovery and conformance.

28
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,260
And in recent lectures we have
extended the scope to also look at

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,590
other perspectives like time,
resources, and data.

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,230
And also look at things like enhancing
models with different perspectives.

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,170
So, this picture ties everything together.

32
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,560
So, how does it work?

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,040
We start with an event log.

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,500
Based on the event log we can create
a process model using process discovery

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,280
techniques or we can also make a model
by hand or a combination of both.

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,330
Then we connect the events in
the event log to this process model,

37
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,120
focusing mostly on the control-flow.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,330
Once we have established that
connection we can start mining for

39
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,020
the other perspectives.

40
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,230
So, we try to find roles.

41
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,650
We try to find bottlenecks.

42
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,840
Where are particular
amounts of time being passed.

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,100
We try to identify guards.

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,530
And we put everything together in
an integrated model that we can return and

45
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,930
use for other types of analysis like,
for example, simulation.

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,440
So let's take a look at
the individual steps.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,720
So start with the control-flow.

48
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
It is discovered or made by hand.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,210
And what is very important
is that we should be able to

50
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,700
align it with the event log.

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,960
Once we do that, we can start looking for
the other perspectives.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,820
We had two lectures on decision learning,
as a learning decision points.

53
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,240
What are the guards involved
in such a decision, and

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,750
we can add that to the process model.

55
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,560
Here in red, you can see the guards.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,850
What is not shown are the variables,
and read and write arcs.

57
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,660
If we extend the model further,
we can also add such information.

58
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,340
We also looked at the time perspective,
finding out where are bottlenecks.

59
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,570
We can attach such
information to activities and

60
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,290
to the,
places in the corresponding Petri net.

61
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,520
We can also capture
routing probabilities so

62
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,550
this way we can enrich the model with
time and performance related information.

63
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,870
Last but not least we can extend
the model with information about

64
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,630
resources the people involved in
the process or the machines being used.

65
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,980
So here you see three roles that we

66
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,000
have learned automatically based
on the event log, and they serve

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,300
as the linking pin between activities in
the process model and individual workers.

68
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,670
So a role corresponds to
a set of activities that

69
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,150
require this role and
a set of people has this particular role.

70
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,860
So we can learn such things automatically,
as we have seen in the previous lecture,

71
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,790
or we can obtain them from
the information system.

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,420
And then we put everything together.

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,180
And such a more holistic model can
be used to diagnose the process.

74
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,130
It gives ideas on re-engineering,
how to improve the process.

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,720
It can also be used for
operational support.

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,370
One of the topics that we will
cover in a later lecture.

77
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,200
For example,
such a model can be used for simulation.

78
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,660
What is very important is that we are
aware of the limits of the models that we

79
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,500
are generating.

80
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,930
They may be over or under fitting.

81
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,520
The models tend to be descriptive.

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,040
They describe what has happened,
not what should happen.

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,970
So when using such more complicated
models, one should be very

84
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,220
much aware of the limitations of the
models that are automatically generated.

85
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,070
Often they are just a starting point for
further analysis.

86
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:12,195
And they require editing adding
additional assumptions etc.,

87
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:16,677
to be really used in subsequent steps.

88
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:21,320
If we do process mining we are often
focusing on the as is situation.

89
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,930
How are things now, where are the
problems, how can we understand, and

90
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,520
explain these problems?

91
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,240
But we would like to move from
as is to the to be situation.

92
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,080
One of the things that we can do for

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,400
example is to use operational support and
to give recommendations and

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,850
predictions to help people doing
the execution of the process better.

95
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,820
We can also use simulation.

96
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,590
And simulation aims to
answer what if questions.

97
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,980
So you have an as-is model and
you explore different to-be situations.

98
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,820
And using simulation you can do that.

99
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,095
So what is simulation?

100
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:07,620
It's just playing out a process model,
so you have a process model and

101
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,740
you just run the process as it has
been modeled you do that several times.

102
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,190
And you can, for example,
collect performance related information.

103
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,770
And this can be used to
explore alternative designs.

104
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,320
For example, designs where two activities
are no longer executed in sequence, but

105
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,150
they are executed concurrently.

106
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,310
You can also see what effect is of
adding resources or removing resources.

107
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,620
This requires us to have a model of
the process itself and it's environment.

108
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,760
And for example to model the availability
of resources and the arrival of new cases.

109
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,410
And process mining of course provides
exactly the input required to

110
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,579
create such simulation models.

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,960
Let's take a look at this
in a bit more detail.

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,698
This picture shows the different
ingredients of a simulation model.

113
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:08,120
For a simulation model, we should
not just know the control-flow, but

114
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,460
we also should have information
about environment of the process.

115
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:19,290
So how many resources are available
when are they available,

116
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,410
what can they do, at what speed.

117
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,620
We should also have information
about arrival process and

118
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,960
all kinds of other information
related to the context of the process.

119
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,290
We can learn much of such
information from process mining.

120
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,880
Process mining is providing information
for example about bottlenecks and

121
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,850
things like that.

122
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,520
We can add that to the process model.

123
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,890
To do simulation
experiments we also need to

124
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,530
decide on things like the number of sub
runs and the length of each sub run.

125
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,900
And the performance indicators
that we would like to measure.

126
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,470
So these are the ingredients.

127
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,090
But if you do a process mining
project in a classical way

128
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,870
you may encounter many problems.

129
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,390
So, this slide identified
ten different risks that you

130
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,520
typically encounter if you
do a simulation project.

131
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,570
So often simulation models have
hidden assumptions which are not

132
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,720
corresponding to reality.

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,830
Using process mining you can avoid many of
the risks that are being highlighted here.

134
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,320
The confrontation with event data helps to
improve the quality of simulation results.

135
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,530
It is very well known that
simulation and

136
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,070
other statistical
techniques can be misused.

137
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,920
And you often see that in
the context of simulation.

138
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,430
Where just by playing with a parameter
which is not really explicit for

139
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,440
the end user, one can influence
the results dramatically.

140
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,940
So one should be very careful when
applying simulation in reality.

141
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,050
Using process mining one can move
beyond traditional simulation.

142
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,870
So traditional business process simulation
often looks at processes in steady state.

143
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,350
In reality processes are often
not in steady state.

144
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,790
For example the arrival process may vary,
the availability of resources may vary,

145
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,310
and this should be
incorporated in the model.

146
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,590
And one can only do that by extracting
information from event logs

147
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,410
to be able to replay processes
in a more realistic manner.

148
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,370
And to explore different alternatives.

149
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,410
Classical simulation models also often
have a very naive view of resources.

150
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,720
Resources that are constantly available,
and are eager to work, and

151
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,970
always work at the same pace.

152
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,480
In reality this is not true.

153
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,110
Process mining helps
to find out these more

154
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,320
sophisticated phenomena in such a way
that they can be added to the model.

155
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,180
Traditional simulation typically
starts with an empty process.

156
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,240
If you are interested
in the transient behavior, so

157
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,100
what will happen tomorrow or what will
happen in a week, then it's very important

158
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,590
to also incorporate the initial state,
the current state into the model.

159
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,360
All of these things helped making
simulation more applicable and

160
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,100
more realistic.

161
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,390
What this diagram also shows is that
it provides very interesting means to

162
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,430
view a reality and
simulation in exactly the same way.

163
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,370
So simulation models can generate
event logs which are very

164
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,150
similar to the event logs that are
generated by the real information system.

165
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,160
And this really helps us
to do what if analysis and

166
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,960
compare reality to all kinds
of alternative scenarios.

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,520
In this lecture we have seen that
we can indeed combine the different

168
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,300
perspectives into one single
complete process model.

169
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,580
That discovering data, time,

170
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,177
resources all tied together using
the control-flow backbone.

171
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,270
Such complete models can be used for
simulation studies, but they

172
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,470
can also be used for operational support,
as we will see in a later lecture.

173
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,373
If you would like to read more
about these models that cover

174
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:40,279
different perspectives, please take
a look at the end of chapter eight,

175
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,949
which is describing the interrelationship
between all the different perspectives.

176
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,132
Thank you for watching,
and hope to see you soon.
