Interative Process Drift Detection is a framework presented by Sato, Ruschel, Scalabrin, Loures and Santos which seeks to prevent potential failures by identfying anomalies up front in the manufacturing process dataset and taking corrective action to support decision-making in the management of Condition-Based Maintenance.
